As IgG subclasses vary in their capacity to activate the classical complement pathway after combining with antigen, we have used an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess levels of IgG1-4 against each dengue serotype in acute and convalescent sera from patients with disease of varying severity. Acute phase sera from patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contained higher levels of anti-dengue antibodies of the IgG1, complement fixing, subclass than similar sera from dengue fever (DF) patients. Conversely, acute phase sera from DHF and DSS patients contained lower levels of anti-dengue antibodies of the poor complement activating IgG2 subclass than acute phase sera from DF patients. No significant differences were detected between the levels of anti-dengue IgG3 and IgG4 antibody in acute phase sera from DF, DHF, and DSS patients. With the exception of levels of anti-dengue IgG2 antibody from DHF patients which were lower than those from DF and DSS patients, levels of anti-dengue IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 were similar in convalescent sera from all patients. These results provide a possible explanation for the activation of the serum complement system which precedes onset of shock in severe dengue infections.","J Med Virol","Journal of medical virology","40","2","102-6","2025-11-04 11:39:35","2025-11-04 11:39:35"

Today the diagnostic of these cysts is safer with C.T.-Scan and M.R.I.; in the 6 cases hydrocephalus was reduced and the volume of the cysts did not increase on C.T.-Scan controls. Nowadays the stereotactic approach seems to be safer than direct surgery but is not always a radical treatment and can be insufficient to treat hydrocephalus. We think that ventricular shunt can be a good alternative as a first and definitive treatment.","Neurochirurgie","Neuro-Chirurgie","36","2","129-31","2025-11-04 11:39:37","2025-11-04 11:39:37"

Consistently, hereditary diseases with mutations in cholesterol-related genes result in impaired brain function during early life. In addition, defects in brain cholesterol metabolism may contribute to neurological syndromes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), and even to the cognitive deficits typical of the old age. In these cases, brain cholesterol defects may be secondary to disease-causing elements and contribute to the functional deficits by altering synaptic functions. In the first part of this review, we will describe hereditary and non-hereditary causes of cholesterol dyshomeostasis and the relationship to brain diseases. In the second part, we will focus on the mechanisms by which perturbation of cholesterol metabolism can affect synaptic function.","EMBO Rep","EMBO reports","15","10","1036-52","2025-11-04 11:39:39","2025-11-04 11:39:39"

Although patients tended to have higher clearance values than volunteers, in both groups the oldest third had the lowest clearances. For the combined group (corrected for the patient effect) the oldest third (mean age 70 years) had a mean clearance of 0.53 versus 0.72 for the middle third (mean age 47 years) and 0.73 ml/min/kg CBW for the youngest third (mean age 26 years). There was no statistically significant age related change in V/kg CBW but t1/2 did rise with increasing age.

Were included in the study hypertensive patients with previous antihypertensive therapy or when in the course of any previous antihypertensive treatment (52.4%) blood pressure control were not observed and side effects compromised patient's compliance. Captopril 25 mg/day was used once a day as single dose or subdivided in two daily doses (12.5 mg b.i.d.), during 30 days. If blood pressure was not normalized or dyastolic blood pressure drop was not equal or bigger than 10% after this period, it was added hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day. After three months under treatment, 411 (87%) patients normalized their dyastolic blood pressure DBP (less than 90 mmHg), from them, 273 (57.6%) had received only captopril and the others 138 (29.4%) with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide. The drop of mean arterial pressure, MAP = 2 DBP + 1 SBP was in average, 17.3 mmHg, in the 3 patients whose blood pressure normalized with captopril alone, and in average of 18.5 mmHg in those patients requiring addition of hydrochlorothiazide (difference without statistical significance). A small decrease of body weight, but with statistical significance (p less than 0.001) were observed during the use of captopril as monotherapy.

This cellular response displayed half-maximal activity at about 1 microM cAMP and saturated at 100 microM cAMP, cAMP-stimulated K+ efflux, measured with a K+-sensitive electrode, depended on the extracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]0) and was maximal in the presence of EGTA. Usually more than 90% of the K+ release could be inhibited by the addition of Ca2+. Half-maximal reduction occurred at about 2 microM [Ca2+]0. Inhibition was also observed in the presence of caffeine or A23187, drugs known to elevate the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Under conditions where [Ca2+]0 was maintained at a low level, half-maximal inhibition was 1 mM for caffeine and 3 microM for A23187. These results indicate that Cai2+ is involved in the regulation of K+ efflux. Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ uptake and K+ efflux induced by cAMP as well as free running oscillations of both ions revealed that initiation and termination of Ca2+ uptake slightly preceded those of K+ efflux.","Biochim Biophys Acta","Biochimica et biophysica acta","1012","2","196-200","2025-11-04 11:39:41","2025-11-04 11:39:41"
"9129864","L Parnetti, U Senin, P Mecocci","1997","Cognitive enhancement therapy for Alzheimer's disease. The way forward.","Although at present there is no definitive treatment or cure for Alzheimer's disease, different pharmacological strategies are being actively investigated. At present, cholinergic therapy and nootropics and some neuronotrophic agents represent the available approaches to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) constitutes the best cholinergic approach to increase acetylcholine levels. Available data suggest that about 15 to 40% of Alzheimer's disease patients show a varying degree of cognitive improvement while taking these medications; however, haematological complications (neutropenia or agranulocytosis), together with hepatotoxicity, need to be considered carefully. Recent data suggest that long term administration of nootropics may lead to a significant improvement of cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease patients compared with untreated individuals, having excellent tolerability. Protocols for the intracerebroventricular administration of neuronotrophic substances are also ongoing. The most promising approaches for the future currently undergoing investigation involve attempts to slow the production of beta-amyloid and/or to inhibit beta-amyloid aggregation. Another rational therapeutic approach would be to inhibit the formation of paired helical filaments (PHF) by increasing and/or modulating the activities of protein phosphatases and kinases. Antioxidant therapy should disrupt or prevent the free radical/beta-amyloid recirculating cascade and the progressive neurodegeneration. Idebenone, a synthetic compound acting as an 'electron trapper' and free radical scavenger, has shown some efficacy in degenerative and vascular dementia; at present, other different molecules having antioxidative properties [lazaroids (21-aminosteroids), pyrrolopyrimidines, nitric oxide blockers, selegiline, some vitamins] are under investigation. Lowering absorption or brain tissue concentrations of aluminium also offers possible therapeutic opportunities for slowing the rate of clinical progression of the disease; in this sense, some evidence exists using the aluminium chelating agent deferoxamine (desferrioxamine). Inflammation also may play a significant pathogenetic role in Alzheimer's disease. As shown by several retrospective analyses, there is an inverse association of anti-inflammatory drug use with the frequency of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Consequently, clinical trials using both nonsteroidal and steroidal molecules have been proposed. These lines of pharmacological intervention represent an important premise for future therapeutic strategies capable of counteracting the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.","Drugs","Drugs","53","5","752-68","2025-11-04 11:39:42","2025-11-04 11:39:42"

Therefore, it is expected of culture cells which are intended to be re-implanted with autologous serum rather than conventional bovine serum. Cell therapy with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), differentiating to various cells, is thought to be curative. To culture hMSC with human autologous serum (HAS) and re-implant them for cell therapy, we developed a completely closed bag system separating serum, comparing proliferation and multipotency of hMSC cultured in HAS with those in foetal calf serum (FCS). HAS was simply, safely and efficiently obtained with the developed closed bag system. Cell proliferation of hMSC cultured in HAS was greater than that in FCS. hMSC, exposed to the defined induction medium containing HAS as well as FCS, differentiated into osteoblasts and adipocytes. These findings suggest that HAS obtained with the developed closed bag system is advantageous in a point of decrease in risk of virus or bacterial infection and foreign protein contamination and enhancement of proliferation of hMSC.","Cell Biol Int","Cell biology international","30","6","521-4","2025-11-04 11:39:42","2025-11-04 11:39:42"

Although MMs have a high content of minerals, they also contain high levels of dietary fiber and associated compounds, which might bind minerals and impair their absorption. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the increased dietary fiber content of MMs would impair gastrointestinal mineral absorption due to the metal-binding capacity of dietary fiber. Thus, the objective of the present study was to feed growing rats with a basal diet, representative of a nutritionally deficient diet, alone or supplemented with a low dietary fiber level MM, intermediate dietary fiber level MM, or high dietary fiber level MM (HF) to evaluate the apparent absorption of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, and copper. The relative apparent calcium absorption was slightly decreased by the HF addition, with no change in the absolute apparent absorption. The absolute apparent absorption of phosphorus and magnesium was increased by the intermediate dietary fiber level MM and HF additions, whereas the manganese absorption was increased only by the HF addition. The apparent absorption of copper was not affected by the MM supplementation. The increased apparent absorption of minerals was always related to the increase in the mineral dietary concentration triggered by the MM. Thus, we concluded that the increased dietary fiber levels in the MMs increased the mineral levels, and MMs with intermediate and high fiber levels may be used to improve the mineral balance of poor diets.","Nutr Res","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","30","9","615-25","2025-11-04 11:39:43","2025-11-04 11:39:43"

In acute MS lesions and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis focal immune attacks damage axons by injuring axonal mitochondria. In progressive MS, however, axonal damage occurs in chronically demyelinated regions, myelinated regions and also at the active edge of slowly expanding chronic lesions. How axonal energy failure occurs in progressive MS is incompletely understood. Recent studies show that oligodendrocytes supply lactate to myelinated axons as a metabolic substrate for mitochondria to generate ATP, a process which will be altered upon demyelination. In addition, a number of studies have identified mitochondrial abnormalities within neuronal cell bodies in progressive MS, leading to a deficiency of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes or enzymes. Here, we summarise the mitochondrial abnormalities evident within neurons and discuss how these grey matter mitochondrial abnormalities may increase the vulnerability of axons to degeneration in progressive MS. Although neuronal mitochondrial abnormalities will culminate in axonal degeneration, understanding the different contributions of mitochondria to the degeneration of myelinated and demyelinated axons is an important step towards identifying potential therapeutic targets for progressive MS.","Mult Scler","Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","20","14","1806-13","2025-11-04 11:39:44","2025-11-04 11:39:44"

Furthermore, the output power of fluorescence was calculated using an equivalent circuit. The measurement results show that the conversion efficiency of the scintillator declined along with the current increase of the X-ray tube while it has weak relation with the change in tube voltage.

"20487773","E Schoffeniels","1980","The biochemical cycle of impedance variation in axonal membranes.","The main feature of our results may be summarized by saying that the cycle of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of some proteins located in the membrane of nerves is influenced by electrical stimulation, inorganic ions and compounds known to interfere with the acetylcholine system or nerve activity in vivo . Though the results bring evidence favoring the idea that the net state of phosphorylation of some protein component could control the conducting state of the axonal membrane, so far they do not undisputably prove that it is so, especially if taken separately. When put together, all the results seem to give sense to the hypothesis according to which the conformation of the protein controlling the sodium conductance of the axonal membrane and for which the name sodium conductin has been coined is directly related to its net phosphorylation state. It is therefore tempting to ascribe to phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes of axonal membrane proteins a major role in the biochemical cycle of impedance variation (IVC).","Neurochem Int","Neurochemistry international","2C","N/A","81-93","2025-11-04 11:39:49","2025-11-04 11:39:49"

For this, ten healthy dogs were anesthetized. Each dog received 3 preanesthetic protocols: atropine (10 microg/kg BW, IM), and as a sedative, romifidine (ROM; 40 microg/kg BW, IM), xylazine (XYL; 1 microg/kg, IM), or medetomidine (MED; 20 microg/kg BW, IM). Induction of anesthesia was delivered with propofol 15 min later and maintained with halothane and N2O for one hour in all cases. The following variables were registered before preanesthesia, 10 min after the administration of preanesthesia, and at 5-minute intervals during maintenance: PR, RR, rectal temperature (RT), MAP, SAP, and DAP. During maintenance, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and percentage of halothane necessary for maintaining anesthesia (%HAL) were also recorded. Induction dose of propofol (DOSE), time to extubation (TE), time to sternal recumbency (TSR) and time to standing (TS) were also registered. The statistical analysis was carried out during the anesthetic period. ANOVA for repeat measures revealed no differences between the 3 groups for PR and RR; however, MAP, SAP and DAP were higher in the MED group; SpO2 was lower in MED and EtCO2 was lower in ROM; %HAL was higher in XYL. No statistical differences were observed in DOSE, TE, TSR or TS. Percentage of halothane was lower in romifidine and medetomidine than in xylazine premedicated dogs also anesthetized with propofol. All the cardiorespiratory variables measured were within normal limits. The studied combination of romifidine, atropine, propofol, halothane and N2O appears to be a safe and effective drug combination for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia in healthy dogs.","Can J Vet Res","Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire","63","1","31-6","2025-11-04 11:39:49","2025-11-04 11:39:49"

We used the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial microparasite Pasteuria ramosa to study genetic variation for host susceptibility and parasite infectivity within each of two populations. We sought to answer the following questions: Do host clones differ in their susceptibility to parasite isolates? Do parasite isolates differ in their ability to infect different host clones? Are there host clone-parasite isolate interactions? The analysis revealed considerable variation in both host resistance and parasite infectivity. There were significant host clone-parasite isolate interactions, such that there was no single host clone that was superior to all other clones in the resistance to every parasite isolate. Likewise, there was no parasite isolate that was superior to all other isolates in infectivity to every host clone. This form of host clone-parasite isolate interaction indicates the potential for coevolution based on frequency-dependent selection. Infection success of original host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were isolated together) was significantly higher than infection success of novel host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were created in the laboratory). This finding is consistent with the idea that parasites track specific host genotypes under natural conditions. In addition, correspondence analysis revealed that some host clones, although distinguishable with neutral genetic markers, were susceptible to the same set of parasite isolates and thus probably shared resistance genes.","Evolution","Evolution; international journal of organic evolution","55","6","1136-45","2025-11-04 11:39:50","2025-11-04 11:39:50"

The hypomethylating agents (HMA) still represent an effective therapeutic option for these categories, especially for the low-risk subgroups. We report the case of a young patient with NPM1mut-AML who underwent a first cycle of intensive induction treatment, achieving a complete remission, but suffered from a serious life-threatening neurologic toxicity. Due to the ineligibility to further lines of intensive chemotherapy, we decided to consolidate the response with azacitidine, administered according to the regular schedule. The minimal residual disease (MRD), monitored through the NPM1 mutation at diagnosis, progressively decreased and became undetectable after 36 cycles of hypomethylating therapy. After 1 year from discontinuation of azacitidine, MRD remains undetectable. Therefore, HMA might still represent a feasible and effective option for patients with low-risk AML, especially when the standard chemotherapy is not indicated, or as maintenance therapy in nontransplantable patients.","Chemotherapy","Chemotherapy","67","1","24-28","2025-11-04 11:39:53","2025-11-04 11:39:53"

Tilmicosin showed a dose-dependent significant decrease in the number of writhes in the acetic acid-induced writhing test and significant decrease in hind paw-licking time in the late phase of the formalin test. However, it did not cause any significant changes in the reaction times to heat stimuli in the hot-plate and tail-flick models. In chemically-induced pains, both dose levels of tilmicosin showed significant effects compared to those of the corresponding standard peripheral analgesic, acetylsalicylic acid (200 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously) being 26.37±2.88 and 43.64±3.85% vs. 73.35±1.44% in acetic acid test; and 19.23±3.85 and 44.90±1.80% vs. 73.63±2.39% in the late phase of formalin test, respectively. These results may indicate that tilmicosin possesses a significant peripheral but not central analgesic potential that may be beneficial in symptomatic relief of pain when it is used in therapy, in addition to its well-established antibacterial effect.","Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol","International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology","29","1","9-16","2025-11-04 11:39:54","2025-11-04 11:39:54"

A perpetrator of hypertensive target organ disease?","Experimental and clinical data suggest salt intake to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. However, the relationship between dietary sodium and blood pressure has been found to be relatively weak, perhaps because causal blood pressure levels fluctuate considerably. We hypothesized that a closer correlation could be expected between salt intake and the degree of hypertensive target organ disease. We reviewed the literature for studies dealing with 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (as a measure of salt intake) and hypertensive target organ disease as assessed by left ventricular structure and function, microproteinuria, cerebrovascular disease, and arterial compliance. Salt intake as assessed by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was found to be a close independent determinant of left ventricular mass in 9 different studies worldwide. A reduction in dietary sodium has been shown to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. There is clinical and experimental evidence, particularly in salt-sensitive patients, that salt intake directly affects hypertensive renal disease, cerebrovascular disease, and compliance of large arteries. The close and partially independent correlation between salt intake and hypertensive target organ disease suggests dietary sodium to be a direct perpetrator of cardiovascular disease.","Arch Intern Med","Archives of internal medicine","157","21","2449-52","2025-11-04 11:39:55","2025-11-04 11:39:55"

Electrophysiological and extracellular ionic changes during acute ischemia in normal and failing rabbit myocardium were assessed. Heart failure was induced in rabbits by combined volume and pressure overload. In perfused papillary muscles, the onset of electrical uncoupling and changes in action potential duration and conduction velocity during acute ischemia were determined. In Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts the changes in extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and pH during acute global ischemia were studied. In perfused papillary muscles, during the first 10 min of ischemia, action potential duration at 80% of repolarization decreased more in preparations from failing than from control hearts (from 174 to 104 ms and from 156 to 119 ms respectively (P < 0.001)). Conduction velocity was significantly lower in failing hearts during ischemia (P < 0.005). The onset of electrical uncoupling was similar in failing and control hearts (mean +/- S.E.M., 17 +/- 1 and 15 +/- 1 min respectively, n.s.). Langendorff-perfused hearts [K+]o, after 10 min of ischemia, was 11.0 +/- 0.4 mM in failing and 9.5 +/- 0.3 mM in control hearts (P < 0.01), while the change in pH was the same. After pretreatment with glibenclamide, an ATP sensitive K+ channel blocker, [K+]o reached lower values after 10 min of ischemia in both failing (8.8 +/- 0.5 mM) and control hearts (7.2 +/- 0.4 mM). During ischemia, action potential duration shortening is more pronounced and conduction velocity is lower in failing myocardium than in control myocardium. [K+]o reaches higher values during acute ischemia in failing compared with normal myocardium. These changes are not caused by an earlier activation of IK.ATP. Increased spatial dispersion in electrophysiological parameters and [K+]o over the ischemic border in failing hearts may explain the higher propensity for reentrant arrhythmias during acute regional ischemia in failing hearts.","J Mol Cell Cardiol","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","28","1","123-31","2025-11-04 11:39:56","2025-11-04 11:39:56"

Most available drugs are toxic, and relapse after cure remains a chronic problem. Growing limitations in available chemotherapeutic strategies due to emerging resistant strains and lack of an effective vaccine strategy against visceral leishmaniasis deepens the crisis. Complete soluble antigen (CSA), from a beta1-4 galactosyltransferase expressing attenuated Leishmania donovani parasite, induced protection against subsequent challenge and during active infections. CSA immunization was effective against both pentavalent antimony sensitive and resistant strains of L. donovani. Majority ( approximately 85%) of the immunized animals showed sterile protection. Resolution of the disease required the presence of T cells, and the recovered animals remained immune to re-challenge. Control of the parasites was dependent on type 1 CD4(+) helper cells, which evolved in the presence of IL-12 and activated macrophages through the production of IFN-gamma. Immunity was adoptively transferable and was dependent on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. CSA immunization led to enhanced IFN-gamma production, while suppressing the IL-10 production. However, CSA immunization did not abrogate IL-4 production. Our results accentuate the need to establish a favorable cellular immunity while intervening with the development of Th2 cells during leishmania infection.","Eur J Immunol","European journal of immunology","39","8","2146-60","2025-11-04 11:39:57","2025-11-04 11:39:57"

Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals and MMG signals by MIC (MMG-MIC) and ACC (MMG-ACC) were recorded simultaneously on biceps brachii (BB) and triceps brachii (TB). Following determination of the isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), 10 male subjects were asked to perform sustained elbow flexion and extension contractions at 30% MVC until exhaustion. We analyzed the root mean square (RMS) for all signals and compared the sum of the power spectrum (SPA) for 3-6 Hz and 8-12 Hz and the ratio of the sum of SPA for 3-6 Hz and 8-12 Hz in SPA for 3-100 Hz (SPA-FT/SPA-(3-100 Hz)) between MMG-MIC and MMG-ACC. During all sustained muscle contractions, the RMS of EMG and MMG-(MIC) was significantly (p<0.05) increased in antagonistic muscle pairs, while the increase was more noticeable for the agonist than for the antagonist. In addition, the antagonist had a significantly (p<0.05) smaller amplitude than the agonist muscle. The RMS of MMG-ACC, however, showed no significant (p>0.05) difference in RMS amplitude and slope between agonist and antagonist muscles during flexion. In extension, the MMG-ACC-RMS amplitude showed a tendency to be higher in the antagonist than in the agonist, while their slopes showed no significant (p>0.05) difference. The SPA for 3-6 Hz and 8-12 Hz in MMG-(MIC) showed a tendency to be higher in the agonist than the antagonist, and the slopes of the agonist were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those of the antagonist in all contractions. In MMG-ACC, SPA and slopes for 3-6 Hz and 8-12 Hz tended not to differ between agonist and antagonist. The SPA-FT/SPA-(3-100 Hz) in MMG-ACC showed that the antagonist was higher than that of the agonist in all contractions. The MMG-(MIC), however, showed a tendency toward no difference between the agonist and antagonist. In the assessment of muscle activity during simultaneous measurement of the agonist and antagonist during sustained muscle contractions, the MMG signal detected by MIC appeared to be less affected by FT than by ACC due to the different inherent characteristics of the two transducers.","J Physiol Anthropol","Journal of physiological anthropology","27","3","121-31","2025-11-04 11:40:03","2025-11-04 11:40:03"

Their relative intensities are known to be highly sensitive to the H-bonding ability of the environment. Properties of the environment of the dye attached to the protein were studied under native-like conditions and at a range of elevated temperatures that are known to facilitate alpha-crystallin chaperone-like activity. We observe that on heating, the environment of the dye becomes more flexible and the H-bonding of the dye with the protein vicinity decreases. The spectroscopic properties observed on heating were partially restored after cooling, but the initial values were not reached on the time scale of our experiments (up to 3 h). This suggests that the changes of the dye microenvironment are connected with the rearrangements of alpha-crystallin quaternary structure. Since there is only one Cys residue in alphaA subunit of alpha-crystallin (whereas alphaB subunit contains no Cys), we attributed the observed temperature-induced changes of the dye's microenvironment to the particular site within alpha-crystallin molecule.","Int J Biol Macromol","International journal of biological macromolecules","36","5","290-8","2025-11-04 11:40:07","2025-11-04 11:40:07"

Study of the linear inclusions by means of tilt-stage electron microscopy indicated that they represent trilaminar sheet-like structures distinct from materials seen in various other storage disorders. This study emphasizes that the inclusions in the adrenal and testicular parenchymal cells morphologically differ from those in the brain macrophages. In the latter they occur as membrane-bound discrete structures while in the parenchymal cells they are always seen lying free in the cytoplasm and associated with cleft-like spaces. This morphologic variation of the inclusions is noteworthy and probably reflects a biochemical difference in the storage materials in these two most severely affected organs. In addition, this study demonstrates the presence of linear inclusions within macrophages in otherwise normal-appearing liver, spleen, thymus and also in the renal tubular cells.

The prepared allantoin-functionalized SF-SA composite scaffolds (AFAS) exhibited excellent mechanical properties, especially featured by similar ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation at breaking to human skin. Besides, the solvent-casting method guaranteed the AFAS to obtain highly transparent properties with sufficient moisture permeability and excellent adhesion in wet state. In vitro cellular experiments demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of the scaffold that attachment and proliferation of NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells was promoted in the presence of AFAS. Furthermore, the scaffolds exhibited efficient hemostatic property, based on rat hepatic hemorrhage model. In a cutaneous excisional mouse wound model, the AFAS significantly improved the wound closure rate, compared with pure SF-SA scaffolds and blank control.

We enrolled 105 patients with HCM who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at baseline (CMR-I) and after ≥2 years of follow-up (CMR-II). LGE rate was defined as the ratio between the increase of LGE extent (grams) and the time interval (months) between examinations. A combined end point of sudden cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, appropriate Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) intervention, and sustained ventricular tachycardia was used (hard events). The percentage of patients with LGE extent ≥15% increased from 9% to 20% from CMR-I to CMR-II (p = 0.03). During a median follow-up of 52 months, 25 hard events were recorded. The presence of LGE ≥15% at CMR-II allowed a significant reclassification of the risk of patients than at LGE ≥15% at CMR-I (net reclassification improvement 0.21, p = 0.046). On the MaxStat analysis, the optimal prognostic cut point for LGE rate was >0.07 g/month. On the Kaplan-Meier curve, patients with LGE rate >0.07 had worse prognosis than those without (p <0.0001). LGE rate >0.07 allowed a significant reclassification of the risk compared with LGE ≥15% at CMR-I and at CMR-II (net reclassification improvement 0.49, p = 0.003). In the multivariable models, LGE rate >0.07 was the best independent predictor of hard events.

However, data that correlate the occurrence of asbestos bodies in paraffin-embedded tissue sections with the quantification of asbestos bodies by tissue digestion techniques have not been available.

When adjustments were made for asbestos body orientation in tissue sections, shrinkage of sections during processing, and conversion of lung volume to wet weight, the agreement between the two techniques was excellent (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001). An average of two asbestos bodies on 2 X 2 cm (4 cm2) iron-stained tissue sections 5 microns thick is equivalent to approximately 200 asbestos bodies per gram of wet fixed lung tissue.","Hum Pathol","Human pathology","14","4","355-61","2025-11-04 11:40:11","2025-11-04 11:40:11"

Biol., Cybernet. 53, 397-403, 1986) to include the effects of local gain control in the retina. The method employed to do this has been to fit a family of difference-of-Gaussian functions to the human contrast sensitivity function curves of van Nes and Bouman (J. Opt. Soc. Am. 57, 401-406, 1967). The centre frequencies of the DoGs within each family are octave-related, in a simplified manifestation of the DoG channels found by Wilson et al. (Vision Res. 23, 873-882, 1983). The sensitivity of each level, or channel, that formed the original Stack model is modulated individually according to the fitted values, as the local illumination varies within an image. The model was tested against psychometric data obtained by Haig and Burton (Appl. Optics 26, 492-500, 1987) during experiments on visual discrimination. The consistency of the results indicates the validity of the approximations and the robustness of the model, either for machine vision purposes or for predicting human visual performance. A simple algorithm, developed for use with a machine vision application of this model, provides a means by which a TV camera may be focused automatically. The success of this algorithm, using the newly computed channel sensitivities, suggests that human focal accommodation may be regulated by a similar form of mechanism.","Spat Vis","Spatial vision","7","1","15-34","2025-11-04 11:40:11","2025-11-04 11:40:11"

The base glass is considered bioactive, because, when soaked in a fluid that simulates the inorganic ion concentration of human plasma (SBF), it develops a bonelike apatite layer on its surface. The aim of this research activity was to toughen this brittle bioactive material and to broaden its biomedical applications. Pure titanium was chosen as toughening phase because of its well-known biocompatibility, and Ti6Al4V alloy as substrate because of both its biocompatibility and its mechanical reliability. At first the composites were prepared as bulk materials, by means of a simple sintering process. Then, by ball-milling the sintered composite, the as-obtained ""composite powders"" were sprayed by Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) on the substrate. By means of Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), the characteristic temperatures of the base glasses were determined. The thermal properties of mixtures of glass powders and different vol% Ti particles were studied by means of DTA, DSC, hot-stage microscopy, and dilatometry, with the aim of optimizing the sintering conditions. Both the bulk and the coated samples have been characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), compositional analysis (EDS), Vickers indentations, and leaching tests after soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF).","J Biomed Mater Res","Journal of biomedical materials research","53","4","408-13","2025-11-04 11:40:12","2025-11-04 11:40:12"

A diagnostic strategy guided by keen clinical judgment should focus on positive symptom criteria and on the absence of alarm symptoms. In younger patients lacking alarm features, invasive testing has a low-yield. The presence of food intolerance and underlying celiac disease should be excluded. The usefulness of fecal tests such as calprotectin and lactoferrin to exclude organic bowel disease is not adequately established. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms who fail initial therapeutic trials, further tests can be performed in tertiary care settings, such as transit measurement and tests for diagnosing pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment strategies for IBS are currently directed at the predominant symptoms. In diarrhea-predominant IBS, opioids (e.g. loperamide) and the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist alosetron are efficacious. In constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and bulk laxatives are traditionally used, but their efficacy is variable and may worsen symptoms. The 5-HT(4) receptor agonist tegaserod is efficacious in female patients with IBS and constipation. In patients with IBS and abdominal pain, antispasmodics and antidepressants can be used, with the best evidence supporting the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants. The efficacy of psychological treatments in terms of relieving the symptoms of IBS is still uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that anti-enkephalinase agents, somatostatin analogues, alpha(2)-receptor agonists, opioid antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, probiotics and herbal treatments may be useful in IBS patients.","Minerva Med","Minerva medica","95","5","427-41","2025-11-04 11:40:15","2025-11-04 11:40:15"

However, the introduction of CNIs has also come at the price of increased patient morbidity, particularly with regard to the well-known nephrotoxic effects of the medications. In an effort to minimize the adverse effects, immunosuppression regimen have evolved to include the use of various induction agents and purine synthesis inhibitors to limit the dose of CNI necessary to achieve low acute cellular rejection rates. Careful assessments of risks and benefits are needed as these newer agents have their own side effect profiles. In addition, the impact of newer immunosuppression regimen on hepatitis C (HCV) recurrence has not been completely elucidated.

To observe the effect of nerve regeneration and motor function recovery after several types of nerve transposition for median nerve defect (2 mm), 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, epineurial neurorrhaphy group, musculocutaneous nerve transposition group, medial pectoral nerve transposition group, and radial nerve muscular branch transposition group. Three months after nerve repair, the wrist flexion test was used to evaluate the recovery of wrist flexion after regeneration of median nerve in the affected limbs of rats. The number of myelinated nerve fibers, the thickness of myelin sheath, the diameter of axons and the cross-sectional area of axons in the proximal and distal segments of the repaired nerves were measured by osmic acid staining. The ratio of newly produced distal myelinated nerve fibers to the number of proximal myelinated nerve fibers was calculated. Wet weights of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles were measured. Muscle fiber morphology was detected using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The cross-sectional area of muscle fibers was calculated to assess the recovery of muscles. Results showed that wrist flexion function was restored, and the nerve grew into the distal effector in all three nerve transposition groups and the epineurial neurorrhaphy group. There were differences in the number of myelinated nerve fibers in each group. The magnification of proximal to distal nerves was 1.80, 3.00, 2.50, and 3.12 in epineurial neurorrhaphy group, musculocutaneous nerve transposition group, medial pectoral nerve transposition group, and radial nerve muscular branch transposition group, respectively. Nevertheless, axon diameters of new nerve fibers, cross-sectional areas of axons, thicknesses of myelin sheath, wet weights of flexor digitorum superficialis muscle and cross-sectional areas of muscle fibers of all three groups of donor nerves from different anterior horn motor neurons after nerve transposition were similar to those in the epineurial neurorrhaphy group. Our findings indicate that donor nerve translocation from different anterior horn motor neurons can effectively repair the target organs innervated by the median nerve. The corresponding spinal anterior horn motor neurons obtain functional reinnervation and achieve some degree of motor function in the affected limbs.","Neural Regen Res","Neural regeneration research","14","4","699-705","2025-11-04 11:40:18","2025-11-04 11:40:18"

These alterations are accompanied by changes in the expression of a variety of molecules in the surviving neurons, as well as axonal reorganization in both excitatory and inhibitory circuits. The alteration of a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons that expresses the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) is thought to be a key factor in the epileptogenic process. We investigated the distribution and density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV-ir) neurons in surgically resected hippocampal tissue from epileptic patients with and without sclerosis. Using quantitative stereological methods, we show for the first time that there is no correlation between total neuronal loss and PV-ir neuronal loss in any of the hippocampal fields. We also observed higher values of the total neuronal density in the sclerotic subiculum, which is accompanied by a lower density of PV-ir when compared with non-sclerotic epileptic and autopsy hippocampi. These findings suggest that, the apparently normal subiculum from sclerotic patients also shows unexpected changes in the density and proportion of PV-ir neurons.","Neuroscience","Neuroscience","149","1","131-43","2025-11-04 11:40:19","2025-11-04 11:40:19"

In mammals, this response is primarily driven by remodeling of brown adipose tissue (BAT), which matures postnatally in altricial species. In many regions, ambient temperatures can vary dramatically throughout the breeding season. We used second-generation lab-born Peromyscus leucopus, cold exposed during two critical developmental windows, to test the hypothesis that adult phenotypic flexibility to cold is influenced by rearing temperature. We found that cold exposure during the postnatal period (14 °C, birth to 30 days) accelerated BAT maturation and permanently remodeled this tissue. As adults, these mice had increased BAT activity and thermogenic capacity relative to controls. However, they also had a blunted acclimation response when subsequently cold exposed as adults (5 °C for 6 weeks). Mice born to cold-exposed mothers (14 °C, entire pregnancy) also showed limited capacity for flexibility as adults, demonstrating that maternal cold stress programs the offspring thermal acclimation response. In contrast, for P. maniculatus adapted to the cold high alpine, BAT maturation rate was unaffected by rearing temperature. However, both postnatal and prenatal cold exposure limited the thermal acclimation response in these cold specialists. Our results suggest a complex interaction between developmental and adult environment, influenced strongly by ancestry, drives thermogenic capacity in the wild.","J Comp Physiol B","Journal of comparative physiology.

Fifty-three patients with LV systolic dysfunction and no regional LV asynergy were divided into 3 groups: relaxation failure group (RF, n=20) with a ratio of peak early diastolic to atrial systolic velocity of the transmitral flow (E/A) < or = 1; pseudonormalization group (PN, n=19) with 1 <E/A<2; and restrictive group (RS, n=14) with E/A> or =2. In addition, 20 normal patients (E/A > or = 1) were studied as a control group. The transmitral and pulmonary venous flow velocities were recorded by transesophageal pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The wall motion velocity patterns were recorded at the middle portion of the LV posterior wall (LVPW) and at the mitral annulus (MA) of the LVPW site in the apical LV long-axis view by transthoracic pulsed TDI. The LVEDP was significantly greater in the PN and RS groups than in the RF and control groups. The moan pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was greatest in the RS group. The percent fractional change of the LA area during atrial systole determined by 2-dimensional echocardiography was significantly lower in the RS group than in the PN group. The peak atrial systolic pulmonary venous flow velocity was significantly greater in the PN group than in the RS group. The peak atrial systolic motion velocity (Aw) at the LVPW was significantly lower in the PN and RS groups than in the RF and control groups. The Aw at the MA was significantly lower in the RS group than in the other groups. There was no significant difference in Aw between the LVPW and MA in the RS group, whereas Aw at the MA was significantly greater than that at the LVPW in the PN group. In conclusion, the measurements of Aw at the LVPW and MA can be used to noninvasively evaluate the hemodynamic relationship between the LA and LV during atrial systole in patients with LV failure.","Jpn Circ J","Japanese circulation journal","63","10","763-9","2025-11-04 11:40:30","2025-11-04 11:40:30"

Acetoacetate or short-chain fatty acids (acetate, butyrate, propionate, n-hexanoate, n-octanoate) accelerate the rate of glucose formation from lactate, fumarate and other precursors in slices of kidney cortex (rat, rabbit, sheep). The cause of this acceleration has been investigated. 2. There are two different mechanisms of acceleration. At low concentrations of glucogenic precursors the acceleration is mainly due to a ;sparing' action. The substances which accelerate are oxidizable and serve as fuel of respiration in place of the glucogenic precursor. This is indicated by the fact that the ratio lactate used/glucose formed falls in the presence of the accelerators and approaches the value 2. 3. At high concentrations of lactate the acceleration appears to be mainly due to the activation of pyruvate carboxylase by acetyl-coenzyme A. The evidence in support of this is summarized. The results indicate that the activation of pyruvate carboxylase by acyl-coenzyme A discovered by Utter & Keech (1963) in purified enzyme preparations also occurs in crude tissue homogenates and can play a part in the control of oxaloacetate synthesis and gluconeogenesis.","Biochem J","The Biochemical journal","94","3","712-20","2025-11-04 11:40:30","2025-11-04 11:40:30"

In 22 spontaneously breathing pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats, inspiration was occluded for 30 s every 2 min for 3 h. After approximately 1.5 h, mean arterial pressure started to fall; heart rate between occlusions was stable throughout, consistent with only transient increases in sympathetic activity during each occlusion. Three hours of occlusions resulted in ventricular diastolic dysfunction (reduced peak rate of change of ventricular pressure and slower relaxation). Post-occlusions, the left ventricular contractile response to dobutamine was blunted. After 1 h of recovery, left ventricular pressure generation had returned to values no different from those in sham animals in 5 of 9 of the animals. Cardiac myofibrils from rats subjected to occlusions had depressed calcium-activated myosin ATPase activity, indicating myofilament contractile dysfunction that was not due to breakdown of contractile proteins. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained cross-sections revealed multifocal areas of necrosis within the septum and both ventricles.

In contrast to many other forms of complementary medicine, naturopathic medicine is regulated partially by law. Legislation of naturopathic medicine has worked well in jurisdictions where it is legislated and has led to uniform standards of education and practice. In addition, regulation has helped with integration and naturopathic cooperation with all other branches of medical science. Within licensed jurisdictions, patients receiving naturopathic care can expect the practitioner to be held to high standards, established by state or provincial law. As alternative therapies become more integrated in nature, conventional medicine will face new challenges. Licensed naturopathic physicians are trained sufficiently to play an active role in this new primary health care team.

Comprehensive ocean measurement programmes aiming to monitor MOC variations have been established in the subtropical North Atlantic (RAPID, at latitude 26.5 degrees N, and MOVE, at latitude 16 degrees N) and show strong variability on intraseasonal to interannual timescales. Observational evidence of longer-term changes in MOC transport remains scarce, owing to infrequent sampling of transoceanic sections over past decades. Inferences based on long-term sea surface temperature records, however, supported by model simulations, suggest a variability with an amplitude of +/-1.5-3 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) on decadal timescales in the subtropics. Such variability has been attributed to variations of deep water formation in the sub-arctic Atlantic, particularly the renewal rate of Labrador Sea Water. Here we present results from a model simulation that suggest an additional influence on decadal MOC variability having a Southern Hemisphere origin: dynamic signals originating in the Agulhas leakage region at the southern tip of Africa. These contribute a MOC signal in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic that is of the same order of magnitude as the northern source. A complete rationalization of observed MOC changes therefore also requires consideration of signals arriving from the south.","Nature","Nature","456","7221","489-92","2025-11-04 11:40:42","2025-11-04 11:40:42"

During this transformation, cells adopt a fibroblast-like phenotype accompanied by profound gene expression changes. While many mechanisms have been implicated in this transformation, studies that focus on the role of epigenetic alterations in this process are just emerging. DNA methylation controls gene expression in physiologic and pathologic states. Several studies show alterations in DNA methylation patterns in iAs-mediated pathogenesis, but these studies focused on single genes. We present a comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using methyl-sequencing to measure changes between normal and iAs-transformed cells. Additionally, these differential methylation changes correlated positively with changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Interestingly, most of these differentially methylated genes function in cell adhesion and communication pathways. To gain insight into how genomic DNA methylation patterns are regulated during iAs-mediated carcinogenesis, we show that iAs probably targets CTCF binding at the promoter of DNA methyltransferases, regulating their expression. These findings reveal how CTCF binding regulates DNA methyltransferase to reprogram the methylome in response to an environmental toxin.","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","7","N/A","41474","2025-11-04 11:40:43","2025-11-04 11:40:43"

Some authors use representational terms to include both subjective experience and nonphenomenal, abstract, explanatory concepts. The reconciliation between the representational and structural frames of reference cannot be achieved by a conceptual stuffing of representations into the system ego as a container. The mediation of mental activities by substructures of the mind is a highly complicated problem with considerable clinical significance. It is useful to distinguish representational concepts which have circumscribed functional capacities from representational systems which parallel the ego in scope. It is not yet possible to claim that we have adequately reconciled our views of memory with representational terms. Just as the alluring prospect of inventing an infinite series of ""instincts"" misled biologists in the past, so must we now avoid an infinite series of representations to which we assign any problematic mental task for explanation. We lack information from object relations theory about what there is in the mind which is not a mental representation. The clinical advantage of representational language and models over the structural hypothesis of compromise formation remains unsettled. There is in principle no conceptual obstacle to the integration in one frame of reference of both representational and structural concepts. This requires clear understanding of the representational structure as the result of compromise formation, as well as an important influence on compromise formation. We could then better study our heritage of shared experience without confusing the precipitates of our experience with the structure of our minds.","Psychoanal Q","The Psychoanalytic quarterly","52","4","564-83","2025-11-04 11:40:43","2025-11-04 11:40:43"

Correlations among the seven subscales partially supported the simplex pattern which claims that the neighboring subscales should have stronger positive correlations than the non-neighboring subscales and that the subscales which are the farthest apart should have the strongest negative relationships.","Psychol Rep","Psychological reports","116","2","388-408","2025-11-04 11:40:46","2025-11-04 11:40:46"

All of these patients had an established haematologic disease and tested positive either for viral RNA or antigen shortly after the beginning of respiratory illness. In three of the patients, influenza virus was repeatedly detected, and four of the patients died in coincidence with the virus infection. Sequencing of the amplified (HA1) haemagglutinin yielded identical nucleotide sequences in isolates from three of the patients, whereas one nucleotide difference was found in the isolate of the fourth patient, resulting in an amino acid substitution (G153R). To investigate the source of infection, the medical staff (n = 104) of the hospital unit was tested and found negative for influenza virus RNA and antigen in pharyngeal lavages. Testing for influenza virus antibodies by immunofluorescence assay revealed that 12 staff members were positive for influenza virus A IgA antibodies. These findings suggest that wild-type influenza virus infections occurred within the medical staff at the same time the patients were infected and that the staff might have contributed to the circulation of virus in the hospital ward.","Arch Virol","Archives of virology","155","11","1797-802","2025-11-04 11:40:47","2025-11-04 11:40:47"

Its effectiveness was evaluated using a questionnaire, pre- and post-tests, focus groups, summative assessment, and tracking data. Since introduced in 2009, a total of 781 students have used RA eLearning, and among them 167 Year 1 students in 2011, of whom 116 participated in the evaluation study. Students enjoyed learning (77%) with RA eLearning, found it was easy to use (81%) and actively engaged them in their learning (75%), all of which were associated to the usability, learning design of the TELT solution and its integration in the curriculum; 80% of students reported RA eLearning helped their revision of anatomy and 69% stated that it facilitated their application of anatomy in a clinical context, both of which were associated with the benefits offered by the learning and activities design. At the end of course summative assessment, student knowledge of RA eLearning relevant topics (mean 80%; SD ±16) was significantly better as compared to topics not relevant to RA eLearning (mean 63%; SD ±15) (mean difference 18%; 95% CI 15% to 20%; P < 0.001).

The present study examined whether excitotoxic cell death induces Fas expression in the adult rat brain. Although relatively light immunostaining was observed in control brain sections, significantly increased Fas immunoreactivity was seen from 4 h to 5 days after the onset of kainic acid-induced seizures. Increased expression of both Fas mRNA and protein were also evident by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Fas induction was correlated with neuronal apoptosis as demonstrated by colocalization of Fas and terminal dT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). Cells with increased Fas-expression were also immunoreactive for tumor suppressor p53 and neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN). These results suggest that Fas receptor may contribute to excitotoxic neuronal death in cooperation with p53, and further implicates the Fas pathway in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.","Neuroreport","Neuroreport","12","9","1979-82","2025-11-04 11:40:49","2025-11-04 11:40:49"

Unlike most prokaryotic FDPs, the protozoan enzymes from the human pathogens Giardia intestinalis and Trichomonas vaginalis are selective towards O(2). UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy showed that, differently from the NO-consuming bacterial FDPs, the Giardia FDP contains an FMN with reduction potentials for the formation of the single and the two-electron reduced forms very close to each other (E(1)=-66+/-15mV and E(2)=-83+/-15mV), a condition favoring destabilization of the semiquinone radical. Giardia FDP contains also a non-heme diiron site with significantly up-shifted reduction potentials (E(1)=+163+/-20mV and E(2)=+2+/-20mV). These properties are common to the Trichomonas hydrogenosomal FDP, and likely reflect yet undetermined subtle structural differences in the protozoan FDPs, accounting for their marked O(2) specificity.","Arch Biochem Biophys","Archives of biochemistry and biophysics","488","1","9-13","2025-11-04 11:40:53","2025-11-04 11:40:53"

The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of genetic algorithms coupled with the spectral angle mapper (SAM) to identify a meaningful subset of wavebands sensitive enough to discriminate thirteen broadleaved vegetation species from the laboratory measured hyperspectral emissivities. The performance was evaluated using an overall classification accuracy and Jeffries Matusita distance. For the multiple plant species, the targeted bands based on genetic algorithms resulted in a high overall classification accuracy (90%). Concentrating on the pairwise comparison results, the selected wavebands based on genetic algorithms resulted in higher Jeffries Matusita (J-M) distances than randomly selected wavebands did.

Individuals carrying high 5-HTT-expressing gene variants display low amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli. Mice overexpressing the 5-HTT (5-HTTOE), an animal model of this human variation, show impaired fear, together with reduced fear-evoked theta oscillations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, it is unclear how variation in 5-HTT gene expression impacts on the microcircuitry of the BLA to change behavior. We addressed this issue by investigating the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PVINs), the biggest IN population in the basal amygdala (BA). We found that increased 5-HTT expression impairs the recruitment of PVINs (measured by their c-Fos immunoreactivity) during fear. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that the depolarizing effect of 5-HT on PVINs was mediated by 5-HT2A receptor. In 5-HTTOE mice, 5-HT-evoked depolarization of PVINs and synaptic inhibition of principal cells, which provide the major output of the BA, were impaired. This deficit was because of reduced 5-HT2A function and not because of increased 5-HT uptake. Collectively, these findings provide novel cellular mechanisms that are likely to contribute to differences in emotional behaviors linked with genetic variations of the 5-HTT.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","40","13","3015-26","2025-11-04 11:40:55","2025-11-04 11:40:55"

However, the closure of posterior neuropore in ETU-induced fetuses is shown to have been disrupted 12 hours after ETU administration. Marked neural tissue overgrowth in the posterior neuropore resulted in neural fold eversion and finally produced a picture of lumbosacral myeloschisis on day 13 of gestation.

However, addition of NP10EO exerted a pronounced shift in bacterial community composition. In situ hybridization analyzing larger phylogenetic groups of bacteria with ribosomal RNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes revealed the dominance of clusters composed of Betaproteobacteria, accounting for up to one-third of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol-dihydrochloride (DAPI)-stained cells in NP10EO amended reactors and only 5% of DAPI-stained cells in the controls. These shifts in populations of larger phylogenetic groups were confirmed by dot-blot analysis of rRNA.

Thus, the sensitivity of the S-A node to norepinephrine was increased by the toxin. These effects of the toxin were not blocked by propranolol. There was a linear relation between the increases in pacemaker rate and cyclic AMP content after application of both the toxin and norepinephrine. However, the slope of the regression line relating pacemaker rate to cyclic AMP level differed with these two agents.

"25229274","Anna Arlinghaus, Friedhelm Nachreiner","2014","Health effects of supplemental work from home in the European Union.","Internationalization and technological developments have changed the work organization in developed and developing industrial economies. Information and communication technologies, such as computers and smartphones, are increasingly used, allowing more temporal and spatial flexibility of work. This may lead to an increase in supplemental work, i.e. constant availability or working in addition to contractually agreed work hours. This in turn extends work hours and leads to work hours in evenings and weekends, causing interferences of work hours with biological and social rhythms for sleep, recovery and social interaction. However, empirical findings on the effects of supplemental work and work hours on occupational health are rather scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between (1) work-related contacts outside of regular work hours and (2) working in the free time with self-reported work-related health impairments in the fourth and fifth European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS 2005, EWCS 2010). Out of these cross-sectional, large-scale surveys, data on n = 22 836 and n = 34 399 employed workers were used for weighted logistic regression analyses. About half of the sample reported at least occasional supplemental work. The results showed an increased risk of reporting at least one health problem for employees who had been contacted by their employer (EWCS 2005), or worked in their free time to meet work demands (EWCS 2010) in the last 12 months, compared to those reporting no supplemental work or work-related contacts during free time. These results were controlled for demographic variables, physical and mental work load, worker autonomy, and several work hours characteristics (e.g. hours per week, unusual and variable hours). The risk of reporting health problems was increased by being contacted both sometimes (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.26, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.14-1.39) and often (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25), whereas the frequency of working in the free time showed a clear dose-response effect (sometimes: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.24; often: OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.47-1.75), both compared to the category ""never"". The findings, thus, indicate that even a small amount of supplemental work beyond contractually agreed work hours may increase the risk of work-related health impairments. Working in the free time was associated with a substantial risk increase and might be a better indicator for actual work load than being contacted by the employer outside of contractually agreed work hours. Thus, in order to minimize negative health effects, availability requirements for employees outside their regular work hours should be minimized. While these effects definitely need further study, especially regarding a quantification of actual supplemental work and its temporal location, addressing the company culture and using incentives and policies might be options to reduce the amount of supplemental work and maintain the risks of health impairments in the working population at a lower level.","Chronobiol Int","Chronobiology international","31","10","1100-7","2025-11-04 11:41:02","2025-11-04 11:41:02"

Import and intramitochondrial sorting of BCS1 are encoded in the N-terminal 126 amino acid residues. Three sequence elements were identified in this region, namely, the transmembrane domain (amino acid residues 51 to 68), a presequence type helix (residues 69 to 83), and an import auxiliary region (residues 84 to 126). The transmembrane domain is not required for stable binding to the TOM complex. The Tom receptors (Tom70, Tom22 and Tom20), as determined by peptide scan analysis, interact with the presequence-like helix, yet the highest binding was to the third sequence element. We propose that the initial recognition of BCS1 precursor at the surface of the organelle mainly depends on the auxiliary region and does not require the transmembrane domain. This essential region represents a novel type of signal with targeting and sorting functions. It is recognized by all three known mitochondrial import receptors, demonstrating their capacity to decode various targeting signals. We suggest that the BCS1 precursor crosses the TOM complex as a loop structure and that once the precursor emerges from the TOM complex, all three structural elements are essential for the intramitochondrial sorting to the inner membrane.","Mol Cell Biol","Molecular and cellular biology","23","7","2239-50","2025-11-04 11:41:05","2025-11-04 11:41:05"

However, little is known about the mechanisms and contributions of the transcriptional regulation of TP53. Here we report that protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta), a ubiquitously expressed member of the novel subfamily of PKC isoforms, transactivates TP53 expression at the transcriptional level. Reporter assays demonstrated that PKCdelta induces the promoter activity of TP53 through the TP53 core promoter element (CPE-TP53) and that such induction is enhanced in response to DNA damage. The results also demonstrate that, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, PKCdelta activates and interacts with the death-promoting transcription factor Btf to co-occupy CPE-TP53. Inhibition of PKCdelta activity decreases the affinity of Btf for CPE-TP53, thereby reducing TP53 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels. In concert with these results, we show that disruption of Btf-mediated TP53 gene transcription by RNA interference leads to suppression of TP53-mediated apoptosis following genotoxic stress. These findings provide evidence that activation of TP53 gene transcription by PKCdelta triggers TP53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage.","Mol Cell Biol","Molecular and cellular biology","27","24","8480-91","2025-11-04 11:41:11","2025-11-04 11:41:11"

Exposure to PM is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in susceptible populations, such as children. PM can contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma, and this is thought to occur because of the presence of electrophiles in PM or through electrophile generation via the metabolism of PAHs. Glutathione (GSH), an abundant intracellular antioxidant, confers cytoprotection through conjugation of electrophiles and reduction of reactive oxygen species. GSH-dependent phase II detoxifying enzymes glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase facilitate metabolism and conjugation, respectively. Ambient particulates are highly variable in composition, which complicates systematic study. In response, we have developed a replicable ultrafine premixed flame particle (PFP)-generating system for in vivo studies. To determine particle effects in the developing lung, 7-day-old neonatal and adult rats inhaled 22 μg/m(3) PFP during a single 6-hour exposure. Pulmonary GSH and related phase II detoxifying gene and protein expression were evaluated 2, 24, and 48 hours after exposure. Neonates exhibited significant depletion of GSH despite higher initial baseline levels of GSH. Furthermore, we observed attenuated induction of phase II enzymes (glutamate cysteine ligase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase) in neonates compared with adult rats. We conclude that developing neonates have a limited ability to deviate from their normal developmental pattern that precludes adequate adaptation to environmental pollutants, which results in enhanced cytotoxicity from inhaled PM.","Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol","American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","48","1","114-24","2025-11-04 11:41:11","2025-11-04 11:41:11"

Six of the eight patients with normal electrocardiograms were demonstrated to have atrioventricular bypass tracts. Five patients had A-V nodal re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia. In two patients the bypass tract could be demonstrated to conduct antegradely when the left atrium was paced via the coronary sinus, while in four the bypass tract only conducted retrogradely. In all seven patients with atrioventricular bypass tracts, the accessory pathway was left-sided.

TQWT has resulted in promising values of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) at the optimum values of its parameters namely quality factor (Q) of 4, and oversampling rate (r) of 3 and at a decomposition level (J) of 2. The MCA-based model is used to process decomposed images for further classification with efficient storage. These images have been further used for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images using ResNet50 and AlexNet convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The average accuracy values achieved for the processed chest X-ray images classification in the small and large datasets are 98.82% and 94.64%, respectively which are higher than the reported conventional methods based on different models of deep learning techniques.

The recent explosion of research in structural priming has made it the dominant means of investigating the processes involved in the production (and increasingly, comprehension) of complex expressions such as sentences. This review considers its implications for the representation of syntax and the mechanisms of production and comprehension and their relationship.

Thus, the total number of genes involved could be large. One key to finding genes for disorders with considerable locus heterogeneity is to detect genetically more homogeneous subsamples. There exist several traits in families who have a child with autism--biochemical, physical, or behavioural--that are likely to reflect underlying genetic heterogeneity and can thus be used to divide families into more homogeneous subsets. These traits (1) show variation in autism samples; (2) are found in non-autistic family members more often than controls; (3) aggregate in particular autism families; and (4) result in increased signals when used in linkage analysis to define 'affected'.","Novartis Found Symp","Novartis Foundation symposium","251","N/A","70-80; discussion 80-3, 109-11, 281-97","2025-11-04 11:41:16","2025-11-04 11:41:16"

More than 50% of postmenopausal women experience lack of vaginal lubrication and frequent vaginal infections [1]. These urogenital complaints were associated with a diminished frequency of all forms of sexual behaviour. Complaints associated with urogenital ageing include vaginal dryness, irritation and pressure, vaginal discharge and infection, vulvo-vaginal pruritus, dyspareunia, post-coital bleeding, urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections. Although these symptoms have affected women for centuries, they are now becoming more widely recognized by health professionals and society in general because of the increased life expectancy, the acceptance of open discussion of this topic, and the advent of effective therapy. Urogenital ageing is a public health issue because of its high prevalence and because early detection and pharmacological intervention may prevent the development of serious conditions such as uterine prolapse and urinary incontinence. Although systemic hormone replacement therapy is frequently used for the treatment of urogenital atrophy, recent attention has also focused on local delivery of estrogen to the affected urogenital tissue. In this era of fiscal constraint, intervention to maintain urogenital health by the use of estrogen must be considered for all postmenopausal women.","Maturitas","Maturitas","22 Suppl","N/A","S1-S5","2025-11-04 11:41:18","2025-11-04 11:41:18"

Test variables included three types of surface roughness, four different loading rates, and two normal stresses. Performance measures included the static and dynamic friction forces coefficients of static and kinetic friction in addition to effective stiffness and effective damping. Moreover, the test results showed that the static and kinetic friction coefficients, effective stiffness, and effective damping decrease with increasing loading rates. Moreover, increasing the normal stress increases the friction force, thus increasing the effective stiffness and reducing the effective damping surface for all surface roughness types.

In these infections, the viral DNA replicates as low-copy-number, extrachromosomal, double-stranded-DNA circular plasmids in the nucleus of the dividing basal cells. When the infected cells begin the process of differentiation, the viral DNA amplifies to a high copy number and virions are assembled in the superficial cells. To study HPV DNA replication, our laboratory generates primary keratinocyte cell lines that contain replicating extrachromosomal HPV genomes. Here, we describe protocols to culture human keratinocytes, to transfect viral DNA into cells using electroporation, to determine the efficiency of genome establishment in cells with a colony-forming assay, and to measure the copy number and extrachromosomal status of viral genomes using Southern blotting.

Based primarily on historical literatures and archaeologic findings the ""Di-Qiang origin"" hypothesis was proposed, in which the Tibeto-Burman speakers were thought to be descendants of the ancient Di-Qiang groups (DQs) who originated in northwest China. However, other evidence also challenge this hypothesis. In the present study, we investigate the distribution of HLA class I and class II genes in Lisu and Nu, two Tibeto-Burman-speaking ethnic groups, using a high-resolution polymerase chain reaction-sequencing-based typing method. Lisu and Nu share similar allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA class I and class II genes. Phylogenetic trees and principal component analysis based on HLA allele frequencies clearly indicated that Lisu and Nu clustered together with high bootstrap value, suggesting their close genetic relationship. The complicated genetic background of TBs was also revealed. The dendrogram based on HLA class II allelic frequencies demonstrated that East Asians clustered together and that four Tibeto-Burman-speaking ethnic groups (Naxi, Lahu, Lisu, and Nu) formed a clade clustering with southern East Asians (SEA), whereas another Tibeto-Burman speaker, Yi, integrated into the cluster of northern East Asians (NEA). Principal component analysis based on HLA class II allelic frequencies supported that TBs could be classified into two groups with Naxi, Lahu, Lisu and Nu scattering among SEA, while Yi locating close to NEA. A clear boundary between NEA and SEA was also observed in the principal component plot based on HLA class I allele frequencies and Lisu and Nu clustered into the SEA. In conclusion, our results provide evidences that not only DQs but also southwest aborigines may be ancestors of the TBs.","Hum Immunol","Human immunology","68","6","550-9","2025-11-04 11:41:25","2025-11-04 11:41:25"

Dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa usually involves glycine substitutions within the triple helix of COL7A1 although other missense mutations, deletions or splice-site mutations may underlie some cases. In recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, the mutations include nonsense, splice site, deletions or insertions, 'silent' glycine substitutions within the triple helix and non-glycine missense mutations within the triple helix or non-collagenous NC-2 domain.

Melatonin receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system. Vanilloids are also valuable as pharmacological tools for investigating neurobiology. This study investigates the utility of agomelatine, a dual agonist of MT₁ and MT₂ melatonin receptor as well as vanillin, a selective agonist of TRPV₁ (vanilloid receptor) in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) induced experimental HD in rats. Locomotor activity (Actophotometer), motor coordination (Rota rod) and learning-memory (Morris water maze) were assessed. Brain striatum oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation-MDA, glutathione-GSH, superoxide dismutase-SOD and catalase-CAT), nitrosative stress (nitrite/nitrate) and mitochondrial enzyme complexes (I, II and IV) were also assessed. 3-NPA has induced weight loss, impaired locomotion, motor coordination as well as learning and memory. It has induced brain striatum oxidative as well as nitrosative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial enzyme complexes (I, II and IV). Tetrabenazine (TBZ) was used as positive control. Treatment with agomelatine and vanillin and TBZ has significantly attenuated 3-NPA induced weight loss, impaired locomotion, motor coordination and learning-memory as well as biochemical impairments.

In this study, the miRNA expression profiles in NPC were first analyzed using miRNA microarray dataset. miR-1278 was identified as the most decreased miRNA in NPC tissues. We then validated that miR-1278 was significantly down-regulated in NPC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, decreased miR-1278 was strongly associated with worse overall survival and poor chemotherapy response. Gain-of-function experiments showed that overexpression of miR-1278 dramatically sensitized NPC cells to DDP and reduced autophagy. Mechanistically, ATG2B was identified as a target gene of miR-1278. More importantly, ATG2B overexpression reversed miR-1278-induced suppression of autophagy and DDP resistance.

A close analog of rutin, isoquercetin, is currently in advanced phase clinical trials. However, the molecular interaction between rutin and PDI is unknown and is difficult to study by X-ray crystallography due to the weak interaction. Here, we generated a molecular model of PDI:rutin complex by molecular docking and thorough molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then validated the complex model through a number of different experimental methods. We mutated the key residues predicted by the model and analyzed the mutants by an optimized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method and a functional assay (insulin reduction assay). The results consistently showed that the PDI residues H354, L355 and E359 are important in the binding of rutin. These residues are next to the canonical major substrate binding site of the b' domain, and were not conserved across the members of thiol isomerases, explaining the specificity of rutin for PDI among vascular thiol isomerases. Furthermore, the inhibitory activities of three rutin analogues were evaluated using an insulin reduction assay. The results supported that the second sugar ring at the side chain of rutin was not necessary for the binding to PDI. Together, this work provides the structural basis for the inhibitory mechanism of rutin to PDI, and offers a promising strategy for the design of new generation inhibitors with higher binding affinity to PDI for therapeutic applications.","RSC Adv","RSC advances","8","33","18480-18491","2025-11-04 11:41:43","2025-11-04 11:41:43"

The caffeine-induced seizure was unaffected by diazepam (benzodiazepine receptor agonist), but was inhibited by Ro 15-1788 (antagonist or partial agonist). beta-DMCM (antagonist or inverse agonist) increased the seizure. Muscimol (GABA-a receptor agonist), baclofen (GABA-b receptor agonist) and AOAA (GABA transaminase inhibitor) did not show significant effect on caffeine-induced convulsion. Bicuculline (GABA-a receptor antagonist) and picrotoxin (chloride channel blocker) significantly potentiated the convulsion at the doses which did not induce it. Caffeine-induced convulsion was potentiated by NMDA with its non-convulsive dose. CPP (competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) and MK-801 (non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) significantly inhibited the seizures. These results suggest that caffeine-induced seizure is not caused by blockade of adenosine receptors. Caffeine may act to beta-carboline sensitive benzodiazepine receptor (Type 1) which has no linkage with GABA-a receptor.

We investigated the additional effect of varying the stimulus intensity on the M100 response. A 37-channel biomagnetometer recorded neuromagnetic fields over the temporal lobe of healthy volunteers in response to monaurally presented tones. The frequency dependence of the M100 latency remained remarkably invariant even at low stimulus intensity.

The inhibitory action of insulin on SEK1 or JNK1 activation was prevented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Expression of a constitutively active form of Akt also inhibited both SEK1 and JNK1 activation, but not that of MEKK1, in transfected 293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that endogenous Akt physically interacted with endogenous SEK1 in cells and that this interaction was promoted by insulin. In vitro and in vivo (32)P labeling indicated that Akt phosphorylated SEK1 on serine 78. The SEK1 mutant SEK1(S78A) was resistant to Akt-induced inhibition. Finally, activated Akt inhibited SEK1-mediated apoptosis, and this effect of Akt was prevented by overexpression of SEK(S78A).

These patients would consequently be expected to be more susceptible to cochleotoxicity, a recognized side effect with single courses of aminoglycoside therapy. The primary aim of this retrospective study was to establish the incidence and severity of auditory deficit in CF patients. Standard (0.25- to 8-kHz) and high-frequency (10- to 16-kHz) pure-tone audiometry was carried out in 70 CF patients, and the results were compared with the results from 91 control subjects. These subjects were further divided into pediatric and adult groups. Of 70 CF patients, 12 (1 pediatric) displayed hearing loss considered to be caused by repeated exposure to aminoglycosides. There was a nonlinear relationship between the courses of therapy received and the incidence of hearing loss. The severity of the loss did not appear to be related to the number of courses received. Assuming the risk of loss to be independent for each course, preliminary estimates of per course risk of hearing loss were less than 2%. Upon comparison with previous clinical studies and experimental work, these findings suggest that the incidence of cochleotoxicity in CF patients is considerably lower than would be expected, suggesting that the CF condition may confer protection against aminoglycoside cochleotoxicity.","Antimicrob Agents Chemother","Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","45","9","2502-9","2025-11-04 11:41:47","2025-11-04 11:41:47"

Most of them have recently developed systems concentrated on extracting and combining features from MRI, PET, and CSF. For the most part, they have obtained very high performance. However, improving the performance of a classification problem is complicated, specifically when the model's accuracy or other performance measurements are higher than 90%. In this study, a novel methodology is proposed to address this problem, specifically in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis classification. This methodology is the first of its kind in the literature, based on the notion of replication on the feature space instead of the traditional sample space. Briefly, the main steps of the proposed method include extracting, embedding, and exploring the best subset of features. For feature extraction, we adopt VBM-SPM; for embedding features, a concatenation strategy is used on the features to ultimately create one feature vector for each subject. Principal component analysis is applied to extract new features, forming a low-dimensional compact space. A novel process is applied by replicating selected components, assessing the classification model, and repeating the replication until performance divergence or convergence. The proposed method aims to explore most significant features and highest-preforming model at the same time, to classify normal subjects from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. In each epoch, a small subset of candidate features is assessed by support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This repeating procedure is continued until the highest performance is achieved. Experimental results reveal the highest performance reported in the literature for this specific classification problem. We obtained a model with accuracies of 98.81%, 81.61%, and 81.40% for AD vs. normal control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and AD vs. MCI classification, respectively.","Sensors (Basel)","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","20","3","N/A","2025-11-04 11:41:48","2025-11-04 11:41:48"

In female, it was expressed and accumulated in oocytes during oogenesis. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization results indicated that miR-202-5p exhibited a typical germ plasm /PGC-specific expression pattern throughout embryogenesis, which was consistent with that of the PGC marker vasa, indicating that miR-202-5p was a component of germ plasm and a potential PGC marker in zebrafish.

Insects associated with human corpses were carefully collected and put into labelled vials. They were then identified using valid taxonomic keys. Fifteen outdoor (67%) and indoor discovered cadavers were examined. All but one was covered at the time of discovery. From these several species of entomofauna played important roles in the minimum postmortem interval (minPMI) estimate. Insects included the orders of Diptera and Coleoptera. Overall, 14 different species of arthropods were identified. Within Diptera, 2 families of Sarcophagidae and Calliphoridae were present in 73% of the cases with Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Chrysomya albiceps Wiedemann accounting for about half of the cases. The latter family members, Calliphoridae, were more frequently (52%) collected in autumn and winter. Only 4/15 outdoor cadavers had beetles. Four species of Coleopterans; namely Dermestes frischii Kugelann, Nitidula flavomaculata Rossi, Creophilus maxillosus Linnaeus and Saprinus chalcites Illiger; were recorded for the first time from 3 corpses in Iran.

Methods A retrospective cohort study that included all patients that were diagnosed with NSCLC from 2009 to 2017 at KKUH. Data obtained from both electronic and paper medical records and the following information were studied: age, gender, smoking, region, subtype of NSCLC, EGFR mutation test result, treatment, T790M mutation test (if required), comorbidities, metastasis. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 21.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results Among 71 patients with NSCLC 18 cases were identified for EGFR positive mutation and only one case for T790M. Deletion mutation in exon 19 represented 50% of total cases. Moreover, it showed that it is more frequent in males and non-smokers with 61.1% (11) and 66.7% (12), respectively. Majority of the cases were above the age of 60 years by 61.1% (11). The mutations reported highest in those living in Najd with a 44.4% (8) and all the mutated cases were adenocarcinoma. There was no statistical significance in the association between EGFR mutation and disease variables. Conclusion Ultimately, we found that the frequency of EGFR and T790M mutations among NSCLC patients at KKUH from 2009 to 2017 was 25.4% and 1.4%, respectively.

This approach enables rapid development of assays for high-throughput screening or reaction monitoring in the linear range of the enzyme kinetic curve. In this paper, we used protein kinase A and kemptide (a well-studied assay system) to demonstrate assay optimization by using micro parallel liquid chromatography. The optimal substrate and enzyme concentrations were determined rapidly and conveniently compared with the traditional methods for determining these parameters. Additionally, the data collected from the same experiment permitted calculations of K (m) for the substrate, V (max), and time-course study. In general, this approach provides two advantages. First, the broad ranges of detectable product conversions facilitate selection and implementation of assay conditions for high-throughput screening. Second, the system permits determination of 50% inhibitory concentration values at less than 1% conversion of substrate to product, thereby validating screening hits in the linear range of the enzyme kinetic curve. Overall, this optimization process can be done in less than 8 h. To demonstrate the ability to monitor a wide range of assay conditions, we varied initial concentrations over eight orders of magnitude within a single experiment. Compared with a classical enzyme kinetics study, this method significantly speeds the target validation process and reduces time associated with assay development and high-throughput screening implementation.","Assay Drug Dev Technol","Assay and drug development technologies","4","6","653-60","2025-11-04 11:42:04","2025-11-04 11:42:04"

The type of DVG most described for influenza infections (deletion DVGs) differs from the most commonly described DVGs from non-segmented negative stranded viruses (5' copyback). This could be attributed to either differences between viruses or the tools used to detect and characterize DVGs. Here we analyze several NGS datasets from people infected with different types of influenza virus using the same bioinformatic pipeline. We observe that 5' copyback DVGs are prevalent in all human clinical samples but not in the cultured samples. To address this discrepancy between clinical and laboratory cultures, we infected cell culture and ferrets with an H5N8 influenza A virus (FLUAV) and analyzed the DVG composition. The results demonstrate that the DVG population is skewed toward 5' copyback DVGs in the in vivo infections and deletion DVGs in the in vitro infections. This demonstrates that there are differences in vivo genome production and in vitro genome production, and this has implications for how the role of DVGs in clinical disease is studied. We also investigate the role the host cofactor ANP32B has in DVG production.","Virus Res","Virus research","339","N/A","199274","2025-11-04 11:42:05","2025-11-04 11:42:05"

These concerns have been proposed to drive symptoms of social anxiety and account for individual differences in social fears and avoidance behaviors (Moscovitch, 2009). Here, we introduce the NSPS and examine its factor structure and psychometric properties across two large samples of North American undergraduate students with normally distributed symptoms of social anxiety. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 3-factor solution representing concerns about (a) social competence; (b) physical appearance; and (c) signs of anxiety. The NSPS was found to have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, strong convergent validity, and adequate discriminant validity. In addition, NSPS total scores accounted for a significant proportion of unique variance in self-concealment (i.e., safety) behaviors over and above established symptom measures of social interaction anxiety, social performance anxiety, and depression. Results are discussed in relation to theoretical models of social anxiety and the potential utility of the NSPS for both clinical research and practice.","Behav Ther","Behavior therapy","42","2","183-96","2025-11-04 11:42:06","2025-11-04 11:42:06"

Yet, the predominant cellular source still needs to be identified as specific roles of the many types of periablational infiltrating immune cells requires further clarification. Here we report the key role of activated myofibroblasts in RFA-induced tumorigenesis and successful pharmacologic blockade. Murine models simulating RF tumorigenic effects on a macrometastatic tumor and intrahepatic micrometastatic deposits after liver ablation and a macrometastatic tumor after kidney ablation were used. Immune assays of ablated normal parenchyma demonstrated significantly increased numbers of activated myofibroblasts in the periablational rim, as well as increased HGF levels, recruitment other cellular infiltrates; macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells, HGF dependent growth factors; fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) and receptor of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-1 (VEGFR-1), and proliferative indices; Ki-67 and CD34 for microvascular density. Furthermore, macrometastatic models demonstrated accelerated distant tumor growth at 7d post-RFA while micrometastatic models demonstrated increased intrahepatic deposit size and number at 14 and 21 days post-RFA. Multi-day atorvastatin, a selective fibroblast inhibitor, inhibited RFA-induced HGF and downstream growth factors, cellular markers and proliferative indices. Specifically, atorvastatin treatment reduced cellular and proliferative indices to baseline levels in the micrometastatic models, however only partially in macrometastatic models. Furthermore, adjuvant atorvastatin completely inhibited accelerated growth of macrometastasis and negated increased micrometastatic intrahepatic burden. Thus, activated myofibroblasts drive RF-induced tumorigenesis at a cellular level via induction of the HGF/c-MET/STAT3 axis, and can be successfully pharmacologically suppressed.","PLoS One","PloS one","17","7","e0266522","2025-11-04 11:42:10","2025-11-04 11:42:10"

In the present work, we proposed a set of breeding strategies to improve weather resilience in dairy goats raised in north-western European Atlantic conditions and dairy sheep raised in Mediterranean conditions while improving production efficiency at the same time. Breeding strategies differed in the selection emphasis placed on resilience traits, ranging from 0 to 40% in the index. Simulations were carried out mimicking real breeding programs including: milk yield, length of productive life, age at first kidding and mastitis incidence in dairy goats and milk, fat and protein yields, and fertility for dairy sheep. Considering the particular climatic conditions in the two regions, the predicted future climate scenarios, and genetic correlations among breeding objectives, resilience was defined as stability to weather changes for dairy goats and as the ability to improve performance under heat stress for dairy sheep. A strategy giving a selection weight of 10 and 20% for goat and sheep resilience, respectively, resulted in the best overall genetic response in terms of both, production and resilience ability. Not considering resilience in breeding programs could lead to a major production loss in future climate scenarios, whereas putting too much emphasis on resilience would result in a limited progress in milk production.","Front Genet","Frontiers in genetics","12","N/A","692121","2025-11-04 11:42:14","2025-11-04 11:42:14"

In this study, the mechanistic toxicology properties of 14-DDA in T-47D cells were further investigated. 14-DDA is found to induce the formation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vacuoles and autophagosomes, with concurrent upregulation of LC3-II in the breast carcinoma cells. It stimulated an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration and caused a collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential in these cells. In addition, both DDIT3 and GADD45A, molecules implicated in ER stress pathway, were significantly upregulated. DDIT3 knockdown suppressed the formation of both ER vacuoles and autophagosomes, indicating that 14-DDA-induced ER stress and autophagy is dependent on this transcription factor.

Some acinar cells showed Bax positivity 1 day after excretory duct ligation, and there were more Bax-positive acinar cells on days 3 and 5 when many apoptotic acinar cells were observed. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that the expression of mRNA for Bcl-2 became stronger as the glandular atrophy progressed and that Bax mRNA strongly expressed on days 1 and 3. These observations suggest that Bcl-2 inhibits duct cell apoptosis and Bax promotes apoptosis of acinar cells during atrophy of submandibular glands.","Int J Exp Pathol","International journal of experimental pathology","89","5","303-8","2025-11-04 11:42:20","2025-11-04 11:42:20"

Parental antagonism occurs when an allele is beneficial when inherited from one sex but costly when inherited from the other because of fitness interactions among kin. Sexual and parental antagonisms together define four genetic niches within the genome that favor different patterns of gene expression. Natural selection generates linkage disequilibrium among sexually and parentally antagonistic loci with male-beneficial alleles coupled to alleles that are beneficial when inherited from males and female-beneficial alleles coupled to alleles that are beneficial when inherited from females. Linkage disequilibrium also develops between sexually and parentally antagonistic loci and loci that influence sex determination. Genes evolve sex-specific expression to resolve sexual antagonism and evolve imprinted expression to resolve parental antagonism. Sex-specific chromosomes allow a gene to specialize in a single niche.","Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol","Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology","6","9","a017525","2025-11-04 11:42:20","2025-11-04 11:42:20"

The acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) specifically marks active genes. While chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses are commonly performed in cell lines, only limited data are available from primary tumors. We therefore examined whether cancer-specific alterations in H3K27ac occupancy can be identified in primary rectal cancer. Tissue samples from primary rectal cancer and matched mucosa were obtained. ChIP-seq for H3K27ac was performed and differentially occupied regions were identified. The expression of selected genes displaying differential occupancy between tumor and mucosa were examined in gene expression data from an independent patient cohort. Differential expression of four proteins was further examined by immunohistochemistry. ChIP-seq for H3K27ac in primary rectal cancer and matched mucosa was successfully performed and revealed differential binding on 44 regions.

We found intramedullary regions where ECF pH shifted to the acid side in the time course analogous to respiratory excitation during the CO2 loadings: the acidic shift occurred just before the respiratory excitation. Since most of the tested regions showed no or few changes in ECF pH, the responsive regions are thought to be specific local environments fitting the central chemoreceptors. Forty (85%) out of the 47 responsive regions were found to be scattered in the ventrolateral medulla, i.e. a long narrow zone extending from the ventrolateral surface to the ventral respiratory group (VRG) areas where inspiratory or expiratory activity was frequently recorded. The responsive regions were not necessarily restricted to the superficial ventral layers. We were also able to find the responsive regions in the dorsal area ventral to the nucleus tractus solitarii, though they were fewer in number (7/47). The distributions corresponded rougly to the areas where we had previously identified the tonically firing neurons excited exclusively by stimulation of the central chemoreceptors.

Because CD8+ T cells have been implicated in this control by multiple lines of evidence, there has been a focus on understanding the potential mechanisms of action of this immune effector population. One type of experiment used to this end has been depleting these cells with monoclonal antibodies in the simian immunodeficiency virus-macaque model and then studying the effect of that depletion on the viral dynamics.

The production of this compound is increasing due to the growing demand and wide application in electrical, electronic, musical instrument, and automotive component industries. The properties of TBC, e.g., the high octanol-air partition coefficient (Koa), high octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), and high bioconcentration factor (BCF), indicate a possibility of its spread in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and bioaccumulation in living organisms. The presence of TBC has been confirmed in soil, sediments, river water, and such materials as microplastic, curtains, and e-waste devices. The compound has potential to bioaccumulate in the food chain of living organisms. TBC has been demonstrated to exert a harmful effect mainly on the nervous and endocrine systems, lungs, and liver. The possible mechanism of toxicity of the compound in the nervous system is based on the generation of oxidative stress by TBC leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells, while mitochondrial damage is considered to be responsible for changes in the respiratory organ. Moreover, the potential of mussels and earthworms to be bioindicators of TBC has been proven. Therefore, the literature review is focused on TBC properties and analysis of the identification and impact of the compound on the environment, living organisms, and human cell lines. Given the many toxic effects of TBC highlighted in the literature, there is a need for more profound research on the safety of TBC and methods for identification and degradation of this compound.","Environ Geochem Health","Environmental geochemistry and health","44","12","4203-4218","2025-11-04 11:42:25","2025-11-04 11:42:25"

The articles' authors attributed access disparities to myriad barriers. We focused our analysis on these barriers to understand the contributing social and political forces. We found that four major, sometimes countervailing, forces shaped access to health care: (a) contextual conditions, (b) constraints, (c) barriers, and (d) deterrents.

Angelo Maffucci was born in 1845 in Calitri, near Avellino, from a farming family. After graduating in medicine at Naples, in 1872, he started his scientific work at the institute of pathology, under Otto von Schrön (1837-1917). He was professor of general pathology in Messina then Professor of pathology at the university of Catania. In 1884 assumed the role of chairman of pathology at the university of Pisa, where he died in 1903. His scientific contribution is recorded in the massive collection of his personal notes, sketchbooks and watercolours. In 1881 he described, for the first time, the disease characterized by an enchondroma with multiple angiomas, known as Maffucci's Syndrome. The most important scientific contribution was in the field of tuberculosis. Maffucci asserted that avian tuberculosis had a different aetiology from the bovine and human forms. This revolutionary theory caused a strong scientific conflict with Robert Kock. In the last years of his life his pioneering research provided the basis for the following modern investigations to produce vaccines from living bacilli. As a person he was described as brilliant and modest, shy and rigorous.","Med Secoli","Medicina nei secoli","16","1","31-41","2025-11-04 11:42:29","2025-11-04 11:42:29"

They contain the T cell antigen receptor genes alpha, beta, and the T cell-specific gene gamma in the germline configuration, and they express functional receptors for IL-3 and nonfunctional receptors for IL-2. The C4 clones are able to home and undergo differentiation in the thymus of sublethally irradiated mice and give rise in vivo to phenotypically and functionally mature peripheral T lymphocytes displaying several antigen specificities. In vitro 5-Azacytidine induces the C4 clones to express Lyt-2 and L3T4 T cell differentiation antigens, and renders them amenable to be switched from IL-3 to IL-2 dependence. However, the C4 clones seem incapable of giving rise to B lymphocytes either in vivo or in vitro. They self-renew in vitro in the presence of IL-3 every 12-14 h.

In the case of zero-inflation, the GRM showed high bias overestimating discrimination parameters and yielding estimates of threshold parameters that were too high and too close to one another, while ZIM-GRM showed no bias.

Here, we find that raising the concentration of external Cs+ (Cs+o) dramatically slows HERG channel inactivation without affecting activation. Replacement of 5 mM K+o by 135 mM Cs+o increased both inactivation and recovery time constants and shifted the mid-point of the steady-state inactivation curve by 25 mV in the depolarized direction (n = 6, P < 0.01). Raising [Cs+]o also modulated the voltage sensitivity of inactivation gating. With 130 mM Cs+i and 135 mM NMDG+o, the inactivation time constant decreased e-fold per 47.5 +/- 1.1 mV (n = 5), and when 20 mM Cs+ was added to the bath solution, the inactivation time constant decreased e-fold per 20.6 +/- 1.3 mV (n = 5, P < 0.01). A quantitative analysis suggests that Cs+o binds to a site in the pore that is influenced by the transmembrane electrical field, so that Cs+o-induced slowing of HERG inactivation is less prominent at strong depolarizations. K+o has effects that are similar to Cs+o and their effects were additive, suggesting Cs+o and K+o may share a common mechanism of action. The strong effects of Cs+ on inactivation but not on activation highlight the importance of ion and channel interactions during the onset of inactivation in the HERG channel.","J Physiol","The Journal of physiology","548","Pt 3","691-702","2025-11-04 11:42:39","2025-11-04 11:42:39"

They play a crucial role in surveillance of peripheral tissues, trapping antigens encountered there, and migrating via the lymphatics to lymphoid organs where they interact with naive T cells thus generating antigen-specific primary immune responses. Until now it has been assumed DC are largely absent from the brain, meninges, and the choroid plexus within the ventricles. Such a situation was thought to partly explain the 'immune privileged' nature of the central nervous system (CNS). The present study of normal rat tissues using single and double immunohistochemistry reveals for the first time that extensive networks of major histocompatability (MHC) class II+/OX62+ DC are widely distributed in sites which may potentially encounter CNS antigens. These sites included the dura mater, leptomeninges, and the choroid plexus. These putative DC were negative when stained with the anti-resident tissue macrophage monoclonal antibody ED2. In addition to the rich networks of DC, dense populations of resident tissue macrophages (ED2+ and ED1+) were also demonstrated in the dura mater, leptomeninges and to a lesser extent in the choroid plexus. The presence of rich networks of DC and macrophages in the vascular and supporting tissues of the brain may play an important role in inflammatory and immune-mediated disorders affecting the CNS, including auto-immune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.","J Comp Neurol","The Journal of comparative neurology","405","4","553-62","2025-11-04 11:42:42","2025-11-04 11:42:42"

Role of anaphylactic immunoglobulins.","The release of intracellular peroxidase (EPO) was investigated in order to evaluate rat eosinophil activation by various immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes. After successive incubations with purified rat IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgE, or IgM and their respective anti-Ig antisera, eosinophils released significant amounts of EPO (up to 26% of the intracellular content) only in the case of Ig with anaphylactic activities (IgG2a and IgE). Other classes and subclasses were unable to induce EPO exocytosis. Selective depletion and reconstitution experiments suggested that mast cells were not required in this process. Similar levels of EPO could be released after interaction of eosinophils with antigen-antibody complexes (IgG2a monoclonal antibody and Schistosoma mansoni antigen) immobilized on nonphagocytosable surfaces. These results indicate that EPO exocytosis can be obtained after cell activation with specific antibodies, and that this mechanism is independent of phagocytosis. A kinetic study of eosinophils from S. mansoni-infected rats revealed that IgG2a and IgE cytophilic antibodies induced EPO release after incubation with either specific antisera or specific antigen, which suggests the in vivo relevance of such findings. The present work underlines the parallelism of interaction of anaphylactic-type Ig with eosinophils and with mast cells. Moreover, EPO release seems to represent an interesting marker of eosinophil activation, because close relationships were established between the present findings and previous work on the effector function of rat eosinophils.","J Immunol","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","134","3","1968-74","2025-11-04 11:42:47","2025-11-04 11:42:47"

However, locoregional recurrence occurs in about 30% of patients after definitive CRT. Recently, the addition of durvalumab as maintenance therapy has shown to improve the outcome of these patients. However, locoregional recurrence will still remain. ""Salvage surgery"" has been performed to achieve local control in clinical practice, although its clinical significance is unclear. In this review, we define salvage surgery as lung resection for local control of the tumor which was not planned initially, after failure or insufficient treatment effect of the initial CRT for locally advanced cancer and evaluated nine studies to gain some insights on its role in the treatment of lung cancer. The time from radiotherapy (RT) to salvage surgery varied considerably (range, 3 to 282 weeks). Salvage surgery was performed for persistent disease (47%) and locoregional recurrence (52%). Lobectomy (63%) and mediastinal lymph node dissections (90%) were the most common procedures. However, the rate of pneumonectomy was higher in salvage surgery (28%) compared to that in lung resection in general. The median morbidity was 41% (range, 15% to 62%) and the mortality was 4% (range, 0 to 11%) which appeared acceptable. The median recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) after salvage surgery ranged from 10 to 22 months and 13 to 76 months, respectively. Favorable prognostic factors of salvage surgery were longer period from RT to salvage surgery and radiological downstaging. The pathological response was also prognostic, although this information cannot be obtained preoperatively. We conclude that salvage surgery can be considered especially for those with late local recurrence or those with the metabolic response. Given the condition where phase III trials are difficult, the accumulation of real-world evidence in a prospective fashion will be necessary.","Transl Lung Cancer Res","Translational lung cancer research","10","1","555-562","2025-11-04 11:42:51","2025-11-04 11:42:51"

To determine whether allergy was an important factor influencing this result, we examined relationships among the results of RAST tests for seven common inhalant allergens and concurrent lung function in 126 subjects who consented to venipuncture. Increasing values for the sum of scores for the seven RAST tests were associated with progressively lower mean levels of small airways function in boys with histories of recurrent wheezing LRI during the preschool years. The association of allergy with lower levels of lung function was largely accounted for by dust mite allergy. RAST results were not correlated with lung function in boys who had experienced zero or 1 wheezing LRI before 6 yr of age or in girls.

A statistical approach is employed by choosing randomly 4000 parameter sets (allelic effects, recombination rates, and strength of selection) for a given number of loci. For each parameter set we iterate the recursion equations that describe the dynamics of gamete frequencies starting from 20 randomly chosen initial conditions until an equilibrium is reached, record the quantities of interest, and calculate their corresponding mean values. As the number of loci increases from two to five, the fraction of the genome expected to be polymorphic declines surprisingly rapidly, and the loci that are polymorphic increasingly are those with small effects on the trait. As a result, the genetic variance expected to be maintained under stabilizing selection decreases very rapidly with increased number of loci. The equilibrium structure expected under stabilizing selection on an additive trait differs markedly from that expected under selection with no constraints on genotypic fitness values. The expected genetic variance, the expected polymorphic fraction of the genome, as well as other quantities of interest, are only weakly dependent on the selection intensity and the level of recombination.","Genetics","Genetics","152","2","807-20","2025-11-04 11:42:57","2025-11-04 11:42:57"

Four distinct scaffolds were fabricated using this approach by four independent cryomilling times. These scaffolds were assessed for their suitability to promote articular cartilage regeneration with in vitro chondrocyte cell culture studies. The scaffolds were characterized for pore size, porosity, swelling ratio, compressive, and thermal properties. Cryomilling time proved to significantly affect the physical, mechanical, and morphological properties of the scaffolds. In vitro bovine chondrocyte culture was performed dynamically for 1, 7, 14, 28, and 35 days. Chondrocyte viability and adhesion were tested using MTT assay and scanning electron microscopy micrographs. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and DNA assays were performed to investigate the extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and cell proliferation, respectively. PCL/PGA scaffolds demonstrated high porosity for all scaffold types. Morphological analysis and poly(ethylene oxide) continuity demonstrated the existence of a co-continuous network of interconnected pores with pore sizes appropriate for tissue engineering and chondrocyte ingrowth. While mean pore size decreased, water uptake and compressive properties increased with increasing cryomilling times. Compressive modulus of 12, 30, and 60 min scaffolds matched the compressive modulus of human articular cartilage. Viable cells increased besides increase in cell proliferation and ECM formation with progress in culture period. Chondrocytes exhibited spherical morphology on all scaffold types. The pore size of the scaffold affected chondrocyte adhesion, proliferation, and GAG secretion. The results indicated that the 12 min scaffolds delivered promising results for applications in articular cartilage repair.","J Biomater Sci Polym Ed","Journal of biomaterials science.

Using a coexpression network analysis, modules of coexpressed genes and hub genes of tissue-specific networks were identified. Of particular, importance is the discovery of the regulatory network of phytohormones during citrus fruit development and ripening. A model was proposed to illustrate how ABF2 mediates the ABA signalling involved in sucrose transport, chlorophyll degradation, auxin homoeostasis, carotenoid and ABA biosynthesis, and cell wall metabolism during citrus fruit development. Moreover, we depicted the detailed spatiotemporal expression patterns of the genes involved in sucrose and citric acid metabolism in citrus fruit and identified several key genes that may play crucial roles in sucrose and citric acid accumulation in the juice sac, such as SWEET15 and CsPH8.

This study examined the event-related potential (ERP) P3 component to target detection (Go), response inhibition (NoGo) and irrelevant nontarget stimuli during auditory and visual A-X continuous performance tasks. NoGo N2 amplitude effects were also analyzed. Participants were 23 Vietnam veterans with PTSD and 13 civilian controls. No group differences were present for N2 or P3 amplitude to Go and NoGo stimuli. The PTSD group, however, had longer P3 latency to NoGo stimuli than controls, regardless of modality. The PTSD group also had greater frontal P3 amplitude to irrelevant nontarget stimuli than controls. Significant P3 amplitude and latency findings were associated with higher hyperarousal and reexperiencing scores from the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The findings suggest that attentional problems in PTSD are related to slowed central processing when response inhibition is required, and to an impaired ability to screen irrelevant information. This study provides further evidence that the attentional impairments in PTSD are not confined to trauma-related stimuli. Heightened arousal appears to enhance the attentional dysregulation seen in PTSD.","Biol Psychol","Biological psychology","79","2","223-33","2025-11-04 11:43:08","2025-11-04 11:43:08"

Building rich content knowledge and learning varied methodologies for teaching and assessment, supported by an awareness of peer role models, were perceived to be features of early growth. Content prioritization, clarity, and customization appropriate for the learner characterized mid growth.

Structurally and functionally damaged mitochondria do not produce sufficient ATP and are more prominent in producing proapoptotic factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this can be an early stage of several mitochondrial disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunctions may be caused by both mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA that code mitochondrial components and by environmental causes. In the following review, common aspects of mitochondrial impairment concerned about neurodegenerative diseases are summarized including ROS production, impaired mitochondrial dynamics, and apoptosis.

Distinct sensitivity to TKI has been observed depending on the type of mutation, with greater progression-free survival in patients with the Del19 mutation. The analysis of OS in the LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 trials showed a statistically significant increase in survival in afatinib-treated patients with the Del 19 mutation, but no significant increase in that of patients with the L858R mutation.

Our calculations reveal that in the amide hydrolysis the reaction barrier is significantly lower in solution than that in the gas phase, in contrast with the mechanism for imide formation in which the solvent has little influence on the reaction barrier. In the model reactions, the water molecules function both as a catalyst and as a reactant. The reaction mechanism starting from the neutral form of N-(o-carboxybenzoyl)-l-amino acid, which corresponds to pH 0-3, is concluded to be the most favored, and a concerted mechanism is more favorable than a stepwise mechanism. This conclusion is in agreement with experimental observations that the optimal pH range for amide hydrolysis of N-(o-carboxybenzoyl)-l-leucine is pH 0-3 where N-(o-carboxybenzoyl)-l-leucine is predominantly in its neutral form. We suggest that besides the acid-catalyzed mechanism the addition-elimination mechanism is likely to be an alternative choice for cleaving an amide bond. For the reaction mechanism initiated by protonation at the amidic oxygen (hydrogen ion concentration H(0) < -1), the reaction of the model compound with two water molecules lowers the transition barrier significantly compared with that involving a single water molecule.","J Am Chem Soc","Journal of the American Chemical Society","125","23","6994-7000","2025-11-04 11:43:19","2025-11-04 11:43:19"

In virus-infected AKR fetal thymus, the programmed cell death caused by treatment with antibody to CD3 was remarkably diminished. A method of establishing thymic stromal cultures from mice of 1 to 3 wk of age is described. Using this method, it was found that SL3-3 virus infection by neonatal inoculation allowed establishment of thymic stromal cultures from organs removed from AKR mice of 30 to 50 days of age and from lymphomas, whereas thymic stromal cultures could not be established from control mice after 30 days of age. Using NFS/N mice which have no endogenous virus, it was shown that infection of thymic stroma precedes infection of thymocytes and that thymocytes are permissive for infection with SL3-3 virus but not for the nononcogenic retrovirus, Akv, yet Akv virus replicates efficiently in thymic stroma. SL3-3 virus integrates randomly in each lymphoma induced by this virus. The lymphomas are clonal or oligoclonal. Pim-1 and c-myc genes commonly rearranged in other virus-induced thymic lymphoma showed rearrangement in only a few lymphomas. A theory is proposed, based on the work presented here and in recent studies, which states that SL3-3 virus infection of thymic stroma allows infection of thymocyte progenitors entering from the bone marrow. These cells are then altered so that their maturation is delayed and their intrathymic survival is prolonged. This permits virus integration and reintegration that results in the genetic changes which transform the cell.","Cancer Res","Cancer research","50","17 Suppl","5631S-5635S","2025-11-04 11:43:20","2025-11-04 11:43:20"

Cloned BHK-21 cells expressing neomycin resistance instead of Mx1 protein (BH1 cells) and original BHK-21 cells served as negative controls. The results showed that the expression of bovine Mx1 protein reduced viral yields by 90% and levels of viral VP1 mRNA by 60%.

In this study, the genome of CyHV2 strain CyHV2-SY (SY) collected from Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, China was sequenced. The complete genome of SY is at length of 290,455 bp with 154 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and a terminal direct repeat (TR) of 15,353 bp. Many variations were found by comparison the sequenced CyHV2 genomes. The ORF10, ORF107, ORF156 of SY genome have insertions or deletions of repeat sequences compared with ST-J1 and SY-C1, which may be used as the marks of SY strains. Besides, the promoter sequence analysis showed that 13 of the 150 ORFs have TATA-box elements and 119 of the 150 ORFs have SP1 cis-acting elements in the promoter region (350 bp upstream sequence of the initiation codon ATG). Twenty-eight viral miRNAs candidates were predicted in the CyHV2 genome and expression of 24 virogenes may be regulated by viral miRNAs. Horizontal transfer analysis indicated that 16 and 2 genes in the CyHV2 genome may transfer from the host and bacteria, respectively.

However, it is considered that most of the flat was not restored to the sufficient amenities for aquatic living things, migratory birds, etc. because none of the ecological mechanisms were understood or planned for. It is therefore investigated in this paper that historical transition factors in ecosystem structure are selected and traced with the diffusion of a public sewerage system, and with environmental factors such as water quality, sediment condition, and aquatic producers in the Yatsu Tidal Flat. As a result, it can be defined that the tidal flat, just like a lagoon, was formed artificially with reclamation and development of its circumference at the first step of transition; the water quality and sediment condition gradually became brackish water and muddy sediment conditions, interactively. The ecosystem pyramid forming orderly layers according to trophic level appeared as a high-bio-production potential in its tidal flat. In the second step, i.e., in recent years, the characteristics of water quality and sediment conditions evolved into a foreshore tidal flat, namely, conditions in the flat observed were that the progression of water included a high concentration of chloride ion as seawater and sediment conditions became sandy. Because of that, the inflowing fresh water and organic mater from the land area decreased with the improvement of the public sewerage system. The ecosystem pyramid was distorted into a chaos pyramid, with inversion of Ulva spp.","ScientificWorldJournal","TheScientificWorldJournal","4","N/A","315-23","2025-11-04 11:43:25","2025-11-04 11:43:25"

Antidotal effect of vitamin K1 and a novel mechanism for the action of warfarin.","An osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell line (U2-OS) has been shown to possess a vitamin K-dependent carboxylation system which is similar to the system in human HepG2 cells and in liver and lung from the rat. In an 'in vitro' system prepared from these cells, vitamin K1 was shown to overcome warfarin inhibition of gamma-carboxylation carried out by the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The data suggest that osteoblasts, the cells involved in synthesis of vitamin K-dependent proteins in bone, can use vitamin K1 as an antidote to warfarin poisoning if enough vitamin K1 can accumulate in the tissue. Five precursors of vitamin K-dependent proteins were identified in osteosarcoma and HepG2 cells respectively. In microsomes (microsomal fractions) from the osteosarcoma cells these precursors revealed apparent molecular masses of 85, 78, 56, 35 and 31 kDa. When osteosarcoma cells were cultured in the presence of warfarin, vitamin K-dependent 14C-labelling of the 78 kDa precursor was enhanced. Selective 14C-labelling of one precursor was also demonstrated in microsomes from HepG2 cells and from rat lung after warfarin treatment. In HepG2 cells this precursor was identified as the precursor of (clotting) Factor X. This unique 14C-labelling pattern of precursors of vitamin K-dependent proteins in microsomes from different cells and tissues reflects a new mechanism underlying the action of warfarin.","Biochem J","The Biochemical journal","269","2","459-64","2025-11-04 11:43:28","2025-11-04 11:43:28"

Serum LH concentrations increased approximately threefold during the first week following castration and thereafter remained elevated (6.6 +/- .7 ng/ml). Castrates not receiving steroid replacement showed a rhythmic pattern of LH release that was of high frequency (mean pulse interval; 85 +/- 5 min) and high amplitude (mean peak concentration, 11.2 +/- 1.4 ng/ml). Chronic administration of estradiol-17 beta via subdermal Silastic implants reduced mean serum LH concentrations (2.1 +/- .3 ng/ml) and blocked the pulsatile pattern of LH release in all steers. Similar administration of testosterone suppressed mean serum LH and blocked pulsatile LH release in two of four animals. The number of implants used in this study provided physiological concentrations of estradiol (9.8 +/- 1.5 pg/ml) and testosterone (4.1 +/- .2 ng/ml) in systemic blood for the two respective treatment groups. Differences in the LH secretory profiles among testosterone-implanted steers may have been related, in part, to differences in the amounts of steroid not bound to serum proteins. These findings demonstrate that estradiol is a particularly potent inhibitor of pulsatile LH secretion in the male bovine and suggest that gonadal steroid feedback on LH secretion may, in part, be imposed at the level of the hypothalamus. The mechanism for pulsatile LH release is discussed relative to a centrally-located luteinizing hormone releasing hormone pulse generator.","J Anim Sci","Journal of animal science","56","1","132-8","2025-11-04 11:43:33","2025-11-04 11:43:33"

We investigated alternative approaches to real-time stability monitoring of assay reagents. We compared functional (ELISA and cell-based) and biochemical (aggregation, deamidation) assay results using temperature-stressed mAb reagents. Data from both assay groups were compared for indications of antibody degradation. Arrhenius model kinetics was used to further extrapolate stability trends. Changes detected by traditionally monitored biochemical changes were not directly predictive of assay function. Instead, monitoring of reportable results was a closer indication of changes in assay performance related to mAb degradation. Using Arrhenius kinetic modeling, we combined forced degradation of individual reagents with reportable assay results to classify reagents into risk groups with associated re-evaluation and monitoring plans. This combined approach mitigates risk by monitoring each mAb reagent individually under stressed conditions while streamlining expiry assignment through simplified Arrhenius kinetics with only limited real-time stability data.","AAPS J","The AAPS journal","22","6","145","2025-11-04 11:43:34","2025-11-04 11:43:34"

Both the roton and vibron bands illuminate interesting quantum dynamics of enclathrated H(2) molecules. The complex vibron region of the Raman spectrum has been interpreted by observing the change in population of these bands with temperature, measuring the absolute H(2) content as a function of pressure, and with D(2) isotopic substitution. Quadruple occupancy of the large sII clathrate cavity shows the highest H(2) vibrational frequency, followed by triple and double occupancies. Singly occupied small cavities display the lowest vibrational frequency. The vibrational frequencies of H(2) within all cavity environments are redshifted from the free gas phase value. At 76 K, the progression from ortho- to para-H(2) occurs over a relatively slow time period (days). The rotational degeneracy of H(2) molecules within the clathrate cavities is lifted, observed directly in splitting of the para-H(2) roton band. Raman spectra from H(2) and D(2) hydrates suggest that the occupancy patterns between the two hydrates are analogous, increasing confidence that D(2) is a suitable substitute for H(2). The measurements suggest that Raman is an effective and convenient method to determine the relative occupancy of hydrogen molecules in different clathrate cavities.","J Chem Phys","The Journal of chemical physics","130","1","014506","2025-11-04 11:43:40","2025-11-04 11:43:40"

The addicted state may be in part due to drug-induced neuroadaptations in the mesocorticolimbic and corticostriatal pathways. Recently focus has been on the role of aberrant glutamate transmission and its contribution to the hierarchical control over these systems. This review will expand our current knowledge of the most recent advances that have been made in preclinical animal models that provide evidence that implicate metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in contributing to the neuroadaptations pertinent to addiction, as well as the role of Homer proteins in regulating these responses. The recent discovery of receptor mosaics will be discussed which add an additional dimension to the complexity of understanding the mechanism of glutamate mediated behaviours. Finally this review introduces a new area related to glutamatergic responses, namely microRNAs, that may become pivotal in directing our future understanding of how to best target intervention strategies to prevent addictive behaviours.","Pharmacol Biochem Behav","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","100","4","811-24","2025-11-04 11:43:43","2025-11-04 11:43:43"

Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS), which are isotropic mixtures of oils, surfactants, solvents and co-solvents/surfactants, can be used for the design of formulations in order to improve the oral absorption of highly lipophilic drug compounds. SEDDS can be orally administered in soft or hard gelatin capsules and form fine relatively stable oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions upon aqueous dilution owing to the gentle agitation of the gastrointestinal fluids. The efficiency of oral absorption of the drug compound from the SEDDS depends on many formulation-related parameters, such as surfactant concentration, oil/surfactant ratio, polarity of the emulsion, droplet size and charge, all of which in essence determine the self-emulsification ability. Thus, only very specific pharmaceutical excipient combinations will lead to efficient self-emulsifying systems. Although many studies have been carried out, there are few drug products on the pharmaceutical market formulated as SEDDS confirming the difficulty of formulating hydrophobic drug compounds into such formulations. At present, there are four drug products, Sandimmune and Sandimmun Neoral (cyclosporin A), Norvir (ritonavir), and Fortovase (saquinavir) on the pharmaceutical market, the active compounds of which have been formulated into specific SEDDS. Significant improvement in the oral bioavailability of these drug compounds has been demonstrated for each case. The fact that almost 40% of the new drug compounds are hydrophobic in nature implies that studies with SEDDS will continue, and more drug compounds formulated as SEDDS will reach the pharmaceutical market in the future.","Biomed Pharmacother","Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie","58","3","173-82","2025-11-04 11:43:44","2025-11-04 11:43:44"

Current biotechnological butanol production is a Clostridial based anaerobic fermentation process. Thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9/EC 2.3.1.16) is a key enzyme in this biosynthetic conversion of glucose to butanol. It catalyzes the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules, forming acetoacetyl-CoA, which is the first committed step in butanol biosynthesis. The well characterized clostridial thiolases are neither solvent nor thermo stable, which limits butanol yields. We have isolated and characterized a new thermo- (IT50 50 °C = 199 ± 0.1 h) and solvent stable (IS50 > 4%) thiolase derived from the thermophilic bacterium Meiothermus ruber. The observed catalytic constants were Km = 0.07 ± 0.01 mM and kcat = 0.80 ± 0.01 s(-1). In analogy to other thiolases, the enzyme was inhibited by NAD(+) (Ki = 38.7 ± 5.8 mM) and CoA (Ki = 105.1 ± 6.6 μM) but not NADH. The enzyme was stable under harsh process conditions (T = 50 °C, Butanol = 4% v/v) for prolonged time periods (τ = 7 h).

On the molecular level, numerous aspects of alcohol stress signaling remain unresolved. We have identified a novel yeast Ring/PHD finger protein that constitutively shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm but accumulates in the nucleus upon exposure to ethanol, 2-propanol, or 1-butanol. Subcellular localization of this protein is not altered by osmotic, oxidative, or heat stress or during nitrogen or glucose starvation. Because of its exclusive sensitivity to environmental alcohol, the protein was called Asr1p for Alcohol Sensitive Ring/PHD finger 1 protein. Nuclear accumulation of Asr1p is rapid, reversible, and requires a functional Ran/Gsp1p gradient. Asr1p contains two N terminally located leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NES) required for nuclear export. Consistently, it accumulates in the nucleus of xpo1-1 cells at restrictive temperature and forms a trimeric complex with the exportin Xpo1p and Ran-GTP. Deletion of ASR1 leads to sensitivity in growth on medium containing alcohol or detergent, consistent with a function of Asr1p in alcohol-related signaling. Asr1p is the first reported protein that changes its subcellular localization specifically upon exposure to alcohol and therefore represents a key element in the analysis of alcohol-responsive signaling.","J Biol Chem","The Journal of biological chemistry","279","27","28174-81","2025-11-04 11:43:46","2025-11-04 11:43:46"

In the present study, the existence of substance P autoreceptor in dorsal root ganglion neurons was identified with a method we developed recently and substance P-activated inward current in the dorsal root ganglion neurons and its ionic mechanism were also explored preliminarily. The majority of the cells examined (68/76, 89.5%) were sensitive to external application of substance P (0.01-10 microM) with a concentration-dependent inward current. This current was found to result from the opening of nonselective ion channel, preferring the Na+ channel. The substance P-activated current can be suppressed by Cd2+ (0.05 microM), which suggested Ca2+ may also be involved. Soon after the neurons had been identified to be endowed with substance P receptor with whole-cell patch-clamp technique, 17 cells were chosen for immunocytochemical staining to detect substance P-immunoreactivity. Seven neurons which were classified into small and intermediate size were found to reveal substance P-immunoreactivity.

We have previously examined these changes in the lamprey, a model system for studying recovery after spinal cord injury. These analyses were performed 8-12 wk after complete spinal cord lesions, a time when most animals have recovered good locomotor function. However, anatomical analyses have been performed at earlier and later times than this. Because there have been no functional studies at these times, in this study we have examined changes between 2 and 24+ wk after lesioning. Functional changes developed at different times in different regions of the spinal cord. Spinal cord excitability was significantly reduced above and below the lesion site less than 6 wk after lesioning but showed variable region-specific changes at later times. Excitatory synaptic inputs to motor neurons were increased above the lesion site during the recovery phase (2-8 wk after lesioning) but only increased below the lesion site once recovery had occurred (8 wk and later). These synaptic effects were associated with lesion-induced changes in connectivity between premotor excitatory interneurons. Sensory inputs were potentiated at 8 wk and later after lesioning but were markedly reduced at earlier times. There are thus time- and region-specific changes in motor and sensory properties above and below the lesion site. Although animals typically recover good locomotor function by 8 wk, there were further changes at 24+ wk. With the assumption that these changes can help to compensate for the reduced descending input to the spinal cord, effects at later times may reflect ongoing modifications as regeneration continues.

The presented work was initiated after a discrepancy was observed for the TDI of an important P450 enzyme, CYP3A4, during early studies of the investigational drug compound AZD3839 [(S)-1-(2-(difluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl)-4-fluoro-1-(3-(pyrimidin-5-yl)phenyl)-1H-isoindol-3-amine hemifumarate]; TDI was detected using a regulatory method but not with an early screening method. We show here that the different solvents present in the respective studies, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, screening method) versus methanol or water (regulatory method), were responsible for the different TDI results. We further demonstrate why DMSO, present at the levels of 0.2% and 0.5% in the incubations, masked the TDI effect. In addition to the TDI experiments performed in HLM, TDI studies with AZD3839 were performed in pooled human hepatocytes (Hhep) from different suppliers, using DMSO, methanol, or water. The results from these experiments show no TDI or attenuated TDI effect, depending on the supplier. Metabolite identification of the compound dissolved in DMSO, methanol, or water shows different profiles after incubations with the different systems (HLM or Hhep), which may explain the differences in the TDI outcomes. Thorough investigations of the biotransformation of AZD3839 have been performed to find the reactive pathway causing the TDI of CYP3A4, and are presented here. Our findings show that the in vitro risk profile for drug-drug interactions potential of AZD3839 is very much dependent on the chosen test system and the experimental conditions used.","Drug Metab Dispos","Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals","41","1","159-69","2025-11-04 11:43:49","2025-11-04 11:43:49"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured with CVB4 and analyzed for cytokine and chemokine receptors by flow cytometry and for expression of transcription factors Tbet and GATA-3 by RT-PCR and Western blot.

In children with type 1 diabetes, a decreased percentage of T-cells expressed CCR2, CXCR6, interleukin (IL)-18R, and IL-12Rbeta2-chain after in vitro stimulation with CVB4 in comparison with healthy children with or without HLA risk genotype. Moreover, we found that children with type 1 diabetes had decreased IFN-gamma secretion and expression of Tbet, both on mRNA and protein level, in CVB4-stimulated PBMCs. Accordingly, children with type 1 diabetes show an impaired type 1 immune response against CVB4 compared with healthy children.

However, in their exaggerated form both can become maladaptive and result in psychiatric disorders. On the one hand, genetic predisposition has been shown to play a crucial modulatory role in anxiety and aggression. On the other hand, social experiences have been implicated in the modulation of these traits. However, so far, mainly experiences in early life phases have been considered crucial for shaping anxiety-like and aggressive behavior, while the phase of adolescence has largely been neglected. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to elucidate how levels of anxiety-like and aggressive behavior are shaped by social experiences during adolescence and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. For this purpose, male mice of a 5-HTT knockout mouse model including all three genotypes (wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice) were either exposed to an adverse social situation or a beneficial social environment during adolescence. This was accomplished in a custom-made cage system where mice experiencing the adverse environment were repeatedly introduced to the territory of a dominant opponent but had the possibility to escape to a refuge cage. Mice encountering beneficial social conditions had free access to a female mating partner. Afterwards, anxiety-like and aggressive behavior was assessed in a battery of tests. Surprisingly, unfavorable conditions during adolescence led to a decrease in anxiety-like behavior and an increase in exploratory locomotion. Additionally, aggressive behavior was augmented in animals that experienced social adversity. Concerning genotype, homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice were more anxious and less aggressive than heterozygous 5-HTT knockout and wildtype mice. In summary, adolescence is clearly an important phase in which anxiety-like and aggressive behavior can be shaped. Furthermore, it seems that having to cope with challenge during adolescence instead of experiencing throughout beneficial social conditions leads to reduced levels of anxiety-like behavior.","Front Behav Neurosci","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience","10","N/A","97","2025-11-04 11:43:54","2025-11-04 11:43:54"

Germline heterozygous mutations in POFUT1 gene cause Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), a skin disease that features flexural reticulated hyperpigmentation and follicular-based lesions. POFUT1 mosaicism has not been described to date. Here, we describe a 9-year-old female with segmental hyper- and hypopigmented patches with overlying eczematous plaques and follicular papules. Employing paired whole exome sequencing of saliva and keratinocytes isolated from affected skin, we found a novel germline heterozygous POFUT1 deletion causing frameshift and premature codon termination and somatic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 20 encompassing POFUT1. Expression levels of POFUT1 as well as other key regulators of the notch signaling pathway-NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and HES1-were reduced in affected keratinocytes compared with normal keratinocytes. Our findings provide the first evidence of POFUT1 postzygotic mutation and a phenotypic expansion of POFUT1 loss of function mutations. We show that a recessive loss of function mutation in POFUT1 produces a distinct clinical presentation with features (e.g., dermatitis) that are absent in the generalized form of DDD.

Some new and useful tests are described that are of value to the plastic surgeon in analysis of the facial deformity and in planning the appropriate surgical procedure to correct the vertical dystopia of one or both eyes. Several cases are illustrated that describe the principal surgical methods of moving the eye up or down without loss of vision. The vertical eye shifts in this series have been in the range of 2 to 3 mm to over 22 mm. No loss of vision was produced by these corrections. The most common difficulties and complications of orbital dystopia corrections are described. The implications of this type of surgery in terms of visual physiology are suggested. The authors conclude that surgical correction of vertical orbital dystopias is possible, safe, and rewarding to the patients. However, they advise that the correction is best performed in young children and by a specially trained team of plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and ophthalmologists.","Plast Reconstr Surg","Plastic and reconstructive surgery","67","2","121-38","2025-11-04 11:44:00","2025-11-04 11:44:00"

Twenty-eight adult cats were used with the tibia as the experimental model site. Deep-frozen allografts stored at -80 degrees C were used to reconstruct a large tibial defect (at least two-thirds of the diaphysis). An intra-medullary rod was used for fixation. The healing was studied by X-ray at observation periods of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 36 weeks. Post-transplantation biomechanical testing was performed using the Shimadzu Universal Testing Machine DCS series with a torsion test device of 50 kg force metre. Parameters studied included maximum torque, torsional stiffness and energy of absorption. The transplanted grafts were compared to the mechanical properties of the internal controls of the normal opposite tibia of each cat. The results of the mechanical tests demonstrated that deep-frozen allografts did not regain normal strength. At nine months, only about 60% of normal torque strength and about 80% of normal torsional stiffness was achieved. Clinically, it is important to employ strong and rigid internal fixation using intra-medullary nailing rather than plating to allow for immediate mobilisation and reduce the rate of graft fracture.","Cell Tissue Bank","Cell and tissue banking","1","3","201-6","2025-11-04 11:44:01","2025-11-04 11:44:01"

The resulting materials were characterized using XRD, N(2) adsorption-desorption isotherms, UV-vis spectra, IR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of SiO(2)-H(2)Ti(4)O(9) was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of aqueous methylene blue dye (MB). XRD and specific surface area results showed that SiO(2)-H(2)Ti(4)O(9) had an interlayer distance of 1.45 nm and a specific surface area of 148 m(2)g(-1). UV-vis absorption spectrum of SiO(2)-H(2)Ti(4)O(9) showed a red shift, indicative of a narrower band gap compared to K(2)Ti(4)O(9). In addition, SiO(2)-H(2)Ti(4)O(9) showed higher MB adsorption capacity compared to H(2)Ti(4)O(9) and K(2)Ti(4)O(9). MB photodegradation over H(2)Ti(4)O(9), K(2)Ti(4)O(9) and SiO(2)-K(2)Ti(4)O(9) followed zero-order kinetics under our experimental conditions, and the photocatalytic activity of SiO(2)-H(2)Ti(4)O(9) was found to be three times higher than that of K(2)Ti(4)O(9), which could be attributed to the increase of interlayer space and specific surface area of SiO(2)-pillared layered titanate.","J Hazard Mater","Journal of hazardous materials","164","2-3","1250-6","2025-11-04 11:44:02","2025-11-04 11:44:02"

The EE% increased from 14% to 22% by decreasing the amount of DMSO from 80% to 25% (v/v) in the organic polymer solution. For the double emulsion, EE% was 22% on average and independent of the organic phase composition.

Black women with breast cancer (BC) in Nigeria have higher mortality rate compared with British women. This study investigated prognostic features of cell proliferation biomarker (Ki-67) in Nigerian breast cancer women. Materials and Methods. The protein expression of Ki-67 was investigated in series of 308 Nigerian women, prepared as a tissue microarray (TMA), using immunohistochemistry. Clinic-pathological parameters, biomarkers, and patient outcome of tumours expressing Ki-67 in Nigerian women were correlated with UK grade-matched series. Results. A significantly larger proportion of breast tumours from Nigerian women showed high Ki-67 expression. Those tumours were significantly correlated with negative expression of the steroid hormone receptors (ER and PgR), p21, p27, E-cadherin, BRCA-1, and Bcl-2 (all P < 0.001), but positively associated with EGFR (P = 0.003), p53, basal cytokeratins: CK56, CK14, triple negative, and basal phenotype using Nielsen's classification (all P < 0.001) compared to UK women. Multivariate analyses showed that race was also associated with BCSS independent of tumour size, lymph node status, and ER status. Conclusion. Ki-67 expression was observed to have contributed to the difference in the BCSS in Nigerian compared with British BC women. Therefore, targeting Ki-67 in the indigenous black women with BC might improve the patient outcome in the black women with BC.","ISRN Oncol","ISRN oncology","2013","N/A","675051","2025-11-04 11:44:05","2025-11-04 11:44:05"

The adrenergic nerves were distributed in both muscle layers, and they were more numerous adcervically. The cholinergic nerves were more numerous in the adtubal part of the cornua and the cervix than in the rest of the uterus, and they predominated in the circularly oriented muscle.

The results were compared with those obtained from the control experiment which was carried out in the same time schedule under infusion of physiologic saline solution instead of somatostatin. Next, the effect of somatostatin on the glucose-induced insulin release from the pancreas was also evaluated. The following findings were obtained. (1) Somatostatin infused at a speed of 2.5 mug/minute into the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery caused a statistically significant inhibition of plasma levels of IRI and IRG and also pancreatic output of these hormones. With the sessation of somatostatin infusion an abrupt rise of the hormones were seen. This ""rebound"" phenomenon was more pronounced in insulin secretion than in glucagon. No significant changes in the plasma glucose levels in either the pancreaticoduodenal vein or the femoral artery throughout the experiment were found. (2)During infusion of somatostatin at a speed of 1.25 mug/minute, insulin response to glucose injected into the pancreaticoduodenal artery in a small dose, as well as having no effect on the plasma glucose level in systemic circulation, was also significantly inhibited. From these findings obtained by direct experiment using the pancreaticoduodenal arterio-venous system, it was confirmed that somatostatin exhibits a direct inhibitory action on pancreas endocrine in a very low concentration in vivo, and it was suggested that this action might be partly due to a reduction in pancreatic circulation.","Nihon Naibunpi Gakkai Zasshi","Nihon Naibunpi Gakkai zasshi","52","3","218-26","2025-11-04 11:44:07","2025-11-04 11:44:07"

In this study, the role of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in residual ridge resorption after tooth extraction was investigated. A polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid copolymer-coated gelatin sponge carrier was implanted with or without rhBMP-2 (1 microg) in the mesial root sockets after removal of maxillary first molars in male Wistar rats. Fine structural and histomorphologic analyses were conducted 3 to 84 days after implantation. Direct bone formation was first observed after 5 days on the rhBMP-2 side, which was transformed into cortical alveolar ridge with a smooth periosteal layer by 84 days, whereas the control side displayed slower healing. Bone histomorphometry revealed greater total bone area and increased bone height after 14, 28, 56, and 84 days on the rhBMP-2 side compared to the control side, and differences were significant after 14, 28, and 56 days. Larger numbers of proliferating cells and densely populated differentiating mesenchymal cells were observed on the rhBMP-2 side than on the control side in the early stage, and chondrogenesis was not observed. The findings indicate that rhBMP-2 may stimulate proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells in the rat maxillary root socket to preserve cortical bone volume in the socket without any evidence of chondrogenesis.","Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants","The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants","16","3","400-11","2025-11-04 11:44:08","2025-11-04 11:44:08"

The dimension-weighting account (DWA; A. Found & H. J. Müller, 1996) explains this intertrial facilitation by assuming that visual dimensions are weighted at an early perceptual stage of processing. Recently, this view has been challenged by models claiming that intertrial facilitation effects are generated at later stages that follow attentional target selection (K. Mortier, J. Theeuwes, & P. A. Starreveld, 2005). To determine whether intertrial facilitation is generated at a perceptual stage, at the response selection stage, or both, the authors focused on specific event-related brain potential components (directly linkable to perceptual and response-related processing) during a compound search task. Visual dimension repetitions were mirrored by shorter latencies and enhanced amplitudes of the N2-posterior- contralateral, suggesting a facilitated allocation of attentional resources to the target. Response repetitions and changes systematically modulated the lateralized readiness potential amplitude, suggesting a benefit from residual activations of the previous trial biasing the correct response. Overall, the present findings strengthen the DWA by indicating a perceptual origin of dimension change costs in visual search.","J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform","Journal of experimental psychology.

Moreover, KiGGS is mentioned within the approach developed by the National Breastfeeding Committee as a possible source of data for breastfeeding monitoring. The data from KiGGS can be used to develop retrospective indicators on breastfeeding for particular birth cohorts. The data demonstrate that the prevalence of children who were ever breastfed tended to rise between the 2001/2002 and 2007/2008 cohorts; however, no significant changes were identified for the 2001-2008 cohorts with respect to breastfeeding duration. Breastfeeding monitoring relies on reports about current trends in the field; due to the periodicity with which the KiGGS study waves are conducted, data on current birth cohorts cannot be provided. Therefore, data on breastfeeding needs to be collected throughout Germany in relation to direct environmental and other factors.

In Magnaporthe oryzae, cAMP signaling is involved in surface recognition and pathogenesis. Deletion of the MAC1 adenylate cyclase gene affected appressorium formation and plant infection. In this study, we used the affinity purification approach to identify proteins that are associated with Mac1 in vivo. One of the Mac1-interacting proteins is the adenylate cyclase-associated protein named Cap1. CAP genes are well-conserved in phytopathogenic fungi but none of them have been functionally characterized. Deletion of CAP1 blocked the effects of a dominant RAS2 allele and resulted in defects in invasive growth and a reduced intracellular cAMP level. The Δcap1 mutant was defective in germ tube growth, appressorium formation, and formation of typical blast lesions. Cap1-GFP had an actin-like localization pattern, localizing to the apical regions in vegetative hyphae, at the periphery of developing appressoria, and in circular structures at the base of mature appressoria. Interestingly, Cap1, similar to LifeAct, did not localize to the apical regions in invasive hyphae, suggesting that the apical actin cytoskeleton differs between vegetative and invasive hyphae. Domain deletion analysis indicated that the proline-rich region P2 but not the actin-binding domain (AB) of Cap1 was responsible for its subcellular localization. Nevertheless, the AB domain of Cap1 must be important for its function because CAP1(ΔAB) only partially rescued the Δcap1 mutant. Furthermore, exogenous cAMP induced the formation of appressorium-like structures in non-germinated conidia in CAP1(ΔAB) transformants. This novel observation suggested that AB domain deletion may result in overstimulation of appressorium formation by cAMP treatment. Overall, our results indicated that CAP1 is important for the activation of adenylate cyclase, appressorium morphogenesis, and plant infection in M. oryzae. CAP1 may also play a role in feedback inhibition of Ras2 signaling when Pmk1 is activated.","PLoS Pathog","PLoS pathogens","8","9","e1002911","2025-11-04 11:44:14","2025-11-04 11:44:14"

At steady-state 12% of the unoccupied receptors and 46% of covalently occupied receptors are intracellular. The apparent first-order rate constant (Kapp) for turnover of the total pool of covalently occupied receptors (0.16 h-1) is 3.8-fold higher than that for unoccupied receptors (0.042 h-1). When unlabeled insulin is added, identical values for both Kapp (0.10 h-1) and distribution (26% internal) are measured for noncovalently and covalently occupied receptors. The rate constant (Kdeg), describing the relative sensitivity of internalized receptor to degradation, is identical (0.36-0.41 h-1) for unoccupied, noncovalently occupied, and permanently occupied pools of internal receptor. Mechanisms for down-regulation postulating: (a) an occupancy-dependent alteration in the conformation of internal receptor increasing receptor sensitivity to internal proteases, (b) a preferential sorting of internal occupied receptor to degradative pathways, or (c) induction of intracellular proteases by insulin, would all reflect a substantial change in Kdeg for occupied receptor and thus are unlikely mechanisms by which insulin increases the rate of receptor turnover.

This is due, at least in part, to destruction of vector-transduced cells by host cellular immune responses (predominantly CD8(+) CTLs) directed against viral proteins and/or immunogenic transgene products. We have previously demonstrated that E1-deleted Ad vectors can lead to persistent expression of human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR) in the lungs of several strains of immunocompetent mice, despite the presence of Ad-specific CTLs. However, we found that these same vectors gave rise only to transient hCFTR expression in the lungs of rhesus monkeys. We have constructed new Ad vectors that coexpress both hCFTR and the ICP47 gene from herpes simplex virus. ICP47 has been shown to inhibit the transporter associated with antigen presentation, thus blocking major histocompatibility antigen I (MHC class I)-mediated antigen presentation to CD8(+) T cells. The Ad/hCFTR/ICP47 vector decreased levels of cell-surface MHC class I molecules on infected monkey and human cell lines. Similar results were obtained with primary human cells and primary monkey airway epithelial cells. In vitro studies showed that the Ad/hCFTR/ICP47 vector decreased cytolysis by both monkey and human CTLs. When Ad/hCFTR/ICP47 was administered to the lungs of rhesus monkeys, it inhibited the generation of Ad-specific CTLs.

Each potential of mean force was then calibrated based upon the umbrella sampling algorithm from the adiabatic energy map that was calculated separately by the ab initio molecular orbital method, and all of the calibrated potentials of mean force coincided well. The calibration method was also applied to the simulations of a peptide dimer in explicit water models, and it was shown that the calibrated free energy landscapes did not depend on the force field used in the classical simulations, as far as the conformational space was sampled well.

The integration of signals deriving from the host neuronal, immune, and endocrine systems with signals deriving from the microbiota may influence the development of the local inflammatory injury and impacts also more distal brain regions, underlying the psychophysiological vulnerability of IBD patients. Mood disorders and increased response to stress are frequently associated with IBD and may affect the disease recurrence and severity, thus requiring an appropriate therapeutic approach in addition to conventional anti-inflammatory treatments. This review highlights the more recent evidence suggesting that alterations of the microbiota-gut-brain bidirectional communication axis may concur to IBD pathogenesis and sustain the development of both local and CNS symptoms. The participation of the main microbial-derived metabolites, also defined as ""postbiotics"", such as bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, and tryptophan metabolites in the development of IBD-associated gut and brain dysfunction will be discussed.

These properties were used to investigate the effect of nor-trimebutine on spinal neuronal activation induced by models of noxious somato-visceral stimulus and acute colonic inflammation. Nor-trimebutine was administered in rats either subcutaneously 30 min before intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid or intracolonically 30 min before intracolonic infusion of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

Nor-trimebutine decreased Fos expression in the thoraco-lumbar (peritoneal irritation) and lumbo-sacral (colonic inflammation) spinal cord in laminae I, IIo V, VII and X. This effect was also observed in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus after colonic inflammation.

In contrast, others argue that a sharp focus on cost and benefits could encourage the development of clear guidelines based on a consensus of good practice. Thus, the time seems right for a consensus conference and this article summarises the outcome of such a recent conference held in Scotland. A group of 80 surgeons, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists were invited as a representative cross-section of clinicians with an interest in colorectal cancer. Seventy per cent of those attending were surgeons. A series of expert presentations were used to lead discussion in four sessions devoted respectively to epidemiology and screening, influence of surgical factors and outcome, the role of adjuvant therapy and planning for the future. Full discussion from delegates was encouraged and computer-collated, key-pad responses allowed documentation of the opinions of the audience in respect of pre-defined questions.

In insects, sid-1-like genes were described from Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori and Schistocerca americana, but were not found in Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. To investigate whether this gene occurs in aphid species, RT-PCRs were performed using degenerate primers designed using the conserved motif of sid-1-like genes. An sid-1-like full-length transcript was amplified from the cotton/melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Homopera: Aphididae), and a fragment was amplified from the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.). The transcript from A. gossypii was 3067 bp long, with an open reading frame encoding 766 amino acids. Sequence analysis indicated that this transcript shares highest similarity with the reported sid-1-like gene in Schistocerca americana (53%, fragment), followed by A. mellifera (44%), T. castaneum (32-44%), B. mori (38-42%) and Caenorhabditis elegans (25%). Analysis of the transmembrane protein topological structure indicated that the protein encoded by this gene has a similar structure to SID-1 of C. elegans. A phylogenetic tree with all available sid-1-like genes suggests that sid-1-like genes may have had a long evolutionary history. Considering its importance in the RNAi pathway, the absence of a sid-1-like gene in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae is worthy of further investigation.","J Insect Sci","Journal of insect science (Online)","8","N/A","1-6","2025-11-04 11:44:35","2025-11-04 11:44:35"

Using an experimental design modeled after previous studies that used scrambled versions of a spoken story (Lerner et al., 2011) and a silent movie (Hasson et al., 2008), we investigate whether listeners perceive hierarchical structure in music beyond short (~6 s) time windows and whether there is cortical overlap between music and language processing at multiple timescales. Experienced pianists were presented with an extended musical excerpt scrambled at multiple timescales-by measure, phrase, and section-while measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The reliability of evoked activity, as quantified by inter-subject correlation of the fMRI responses, was measured. We found that response reliability depended systematically on musical structure coherence, revealing a topographically organized hierarchy of processing timescales. Early auditory areas (at the bottom of the hierarchy) responded reliably in all conditions. For brain areas at the top of the hierarchy, the original (unscrambled) excerpt evoked more reliable responses than any of the scrambled excerpts, indicating that these brain areas process long-timescale musical structures, on the order of minutes. The topography of processing timescales was analogous with that reported previously for speech, but the timescale gradients for music and speech overlapped with one another only partially, suggesting that temporally analogous structures-words/measures, sentences/musical phrases, paragraph/sections-are processed separately.","Front Neurosci","Frontiers in neuroscience","9","N/A","157","2025-11-04 11:44:37","2025-11-04 11:44:37"

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and autophagy are reported to be upregulated in the AD specimens. However, the interaction between HIF-1α and autophagy in the pathogenesis of AD remains to be explored. HIF-1α and LC3 levels are evaluated in 10 AD and 10 normal aortic specimens. MDC staining, autophagic vacuoles, and autophagic flux are detected in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) under hypoxia treatment. CCK-8, transwell, and wound healing assay are used to identify proliferation and migration under hypoxia treatment. Furthermore, 3-MA is used to inhibit autophagy in hypoxia-treated HASMCs. This study reveals that AD tissues highly express HIF-1α and the LC3. Autophagy is induced under hypoxia in a time-dependent manner, and autophagy is positively related to HIF-1α in HASMCs. Moreover, the proliferation and migration of HASMCs are enhanced by hypoxia, whereas the knockdown of HIF-1α attenuates this effect. Additionally, inhibiting autophagy with 3-MA ameliorates hypoxia-induced proliferation and migration of HASMCs. In summary, the above results indicate that HIF-1α facilitates HASMC proliferation and migration by upregulating autophagy in a hypoxic microenvironment. Thus, inhibition of autophagy may be a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of AD.","Adv Biol (Weinh)","Advanced biology","8","1","e2300292","2025-11-04 11:44:38","2025-11-04 11:44:38"

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus with occult transmission by many mutations and a long incubation period. In particular, the emergence of asymptomatic infections has made the epidemic even more severe. Therefore, early diagnosis and timely management of suspected cases are essential measures to control the spread of the virus. Developing simple, portable, and accurate diagnostic techniques for SARS-CoV-2 is the key to epidemic prevention. The advantages of point-of-care testing technology make it play an increasingly important role in viral detection and screening. This review summarizes the point-of-care testing platforms developed by nucleic acid detection, immunological detection, and nanomaterial-based biosensors detection. Furthermore, this paper provides a prospect for designing future highly accurate, cheap, and convenient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic technology.","Chin Chem Lett","Chinese chemical letters = Zhongguo hua xue kuai bao","N/A","N/A","108688","2025-11-04 11:44:39","2025-11-04 11:44:39"

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the beta adrenergic agonist terbutaline on NGF increase caused by allergic inflammation in rats. 2. Intraplantar antigen injection in sensitized rats increased paw volume and stimulated NGF biosynthesis in the skin of the injected paw as determined 3 and 6 h after injection. Treatment of rats with terbutaline (0.1 - 0.3 mg kg(-1), s.c.) had no significant effect on the NGF concentration in non-inflamed skin, but reduced oedema, and at 0.3 mg kg(-1) also NGF mRNA and immunoreactive NGF in the skin of the inflamed paw in a propranolol-reversible manner. In carrageenan-induced inflammation, terbutaline did not significantly reduce the inflammation-induced increase of NGF in paw skin. 3. Exposure of sensitized rats to aerosolized antigen (twice, 24 h interval) increased protein content, eosinophil leukocytes, and immunoreactive NGF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL, obtained 16 h after the second antigen exposure). Treatment of rats with terbutaline (0.3 mg kg(-1), s.c. 30 min before the second antigen challenge) suppressed antigen-induced elevation of protein and eosinophil leukocytes, and reduced the concentration of NGF in BAL to values similar to those found in non-sensitized rats. 4. The present results demonstrate anti-allergic properties of terbutaline in rats that were accompanied by a marked reduction of antigen-induced NGF increase in skin and BAL, respectively. These results are compatible with the assumption that terbutaline primarily suppressed the immune response to antigen thereby attenuating the release of vasoactive mediators and the stimulation of NGF biosynthesis.","Br J Pharmacol","British journal of pharmacology","133","1","186-92","2025-11-04 11:44:45","2025-11-04 11:44:45"

For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.","J Dairy Sci","Journal of dairy science","85","4","721-9","2025-11-04 11:44:47","2025-11-04 11:44:47"

Due to their small size, easy entrance to cells and multiple targets, microRNAs (miRs) are considered novel and attractive targets. In the current study, parental MKN-45, MKN-45-control vector, and MKN-45-miR-31 populations were compared in terms of cell cycle transitions, migration, cell invasion, and proliferation. In addition, downstream targets of miR-31, including E2F6, and SMUG1 were examined using Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. MKN-45-miR-31 showed an increased sensitivity to 5-FU, decreased migration and cell invasion compared to the control groups (p = 0.0001, p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). There was a significant increase in the percentage of cells in G1/pre-G1 phase in MKN-45-miR-31 relative to the control groups (p = 0.001). Induction of miR-31 expression in MKN-45 caused a significant reduction of E2F6 and SMUG1 genes. Our findings indicated that induction of miR-31 expression could increase drug sensitivity, and diminish tumor cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, miR-31 can be considered as a potential target molecule in the targeted therapy of gastric cancer (Fig. 2, Ref. 43).

Age-related involution may affect the ability of the thymus to reconstitute T cells expressing CD4 cell-surface antigens that are lost during HIV infection; this effect has been seen after chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplantation. Adult HIV-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) show a progressive increase in their number of naive CD4-positive T cells. These cells could arise through expansion of existing naive T cells in the periphery or through thymic production of new naive T cells. Here we quantify thymic output by measuring the excisional DNA products of TCR-gene rearrangement. We find that, although thymic function declines with age, substantial output is maintained into late adulthood. HIV infection leads to a decrease in thymic function that can be measured in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. In adults treated with HAART, there is a rapid and sustained increase in thymic output in most subjects. These results indicate that the adult thymus can contribute to immune reconstitution following HAART.","Nature","Nature","396","6712","690-5","2025-11-04 11:44:58","2025-11-04 11:44:58"

In some plant species, application of magnesium (Mg(2+)) can alleviate Al toxicity. However, it remains unknown whether overexpression of magnesium transport proteins can improve Al tolerance. Here, the role of AtMGT1, a member of the Arabidopsis magnesium transport family involved in Mg(2+) transport, played in Al tolerance in higher plants was investigated. Expression of 35S::AtMGT1 led to various phenotypic alterations in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Transgenic plants harbouring 35S::AtMGT1 exhibited tolerance to Mg(2+) deficiency. Element assay showed that the contents of Mg, Mn, and Fe in 35S::AtMGT1 plants increased compared with wild-type plants. Root growth experiment revealed that 100 microM AlCl(3) caused a reduction in root elongation by 47% in transgenic lines, whereas root growth in wild-type plants was inhibited completely. Upon Al treatment, representative transgenic lines also showed a much lower callose deposition, an indicator of increased Al tolerance, than wild-type plants. Taken together, the results have demonstrated that overexpression of ATMGT1 encoding a magnesium transport protein can improve tolerance to Al in higher plants.","J Exp Bot","Journal of experimental botany","57","15","4235-43","2025-11-04 11:45:01","2025-11-04 11:45:01"

Marked thrombocytosis, a high packed cell volume (PCV) and the thrombotic onset were not significantly related to the thrombotic risk. Platelet count and PCV at the time of the occlusive episode did not correlate with the clinical event; however, inadequate control of the proliferative disease seemed to increase the thrombotic tendency.

To better understand the perceptions of OPD staff regarding priority setting, treatment frequency, treatment duration, and wait list management strategies, we conducted an Interpretive Description study involving semi-structured interviews in three OPDs in Montreal. Participants discussed factors that influenced their decision making about who was prioritized to receive care, strategies that were used to respond to an imbalance between needs and resources in the OPDs and procedures to manage wait lists to help improve access to care. While clinical needs are central in approaches to prioritization, other non-clinical factors relating to the patient, the physiotherapist, and the institution also influence decisions. We examine these findings through the lens of complexity theory, providing insight into opportunities and obstacles for the implementation of management strategies in OPDs.

However, the finite aperture of optical systems limits the value of the angular index. In order to fully use the orthogonal mode channels supported in the fiber for high-capacity communications, we propose extending the radial indices p of OAM modes as an additional multiplexing dimension. In this paper, we introduce spatially discrete multiple phase planes to multiplex the angular and radial OAM modes simultaneously. Due to the orthogonal property of the central symmetric OAM modes, a two-dimensional (2D) input Gaussian beams array can be converted to coaxial OAM modes through Cartesian to log-polar coordinate transformation by inverse design. For a proof-of-concept demonstration, a 10-mode multiplexer for high-order radial OAM modes was designed using five phase planes. The fabricated multiplexer generated high-quality multiplexed OAM modes with a loss of less than 5.4 dB. The multiplexed OAM modes were coupled into a specially designed ring-core fiber by mode-field matching, achieving stable mode transmission in 2 km fiber. The approach provides a scalable technology to increase the number of transmission channels and could lead to the practical applications of OAM multiplexing in communication.","Opt Lett","Optics letters","48","14","3717-3720","2025-11-04 11:45:07","2025-11-04 11:45:07"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship and predictors of common fatigue indices during downhill skiing. Ten healthy female recreational skiers skied for 3 hours under standardized conditions. Feedback on heart rate (HR) and finishing time were given to each skier at the end of each run to maintain a relatively stable load. A chronic stress score (Cstress) was calculated from creatine kinase (CK), cortisol, and isometric endurance. Finishing times and HR from runs 2, 12, and 24 were similar. Heart rate averaged 82% of HRmax. Heart rate was an insignificant predictor (p = .65) and was poorly correlated (r = 0.16) to Cstress. Blood lactate (LA) was a significant predictor of the Cstress (p = 0.05; r = 0.62). Pre- to postskiing peak forces were not different (p = 0.62), but skiers experienced a significant decrease in isometric endurance from 106.1 +/- 29.6 to 93.2 +/- 24.0 seconds. Endurance decreased by 13%, whereas cortisol and CK increased by 16 and 42%, respectively. Isometric contraction endurance and blood LA were significant predictors of overall stress. Individual compensation mechanisms and skiing style contributed to highly variable responses during skiing. Whereas HR may indicate stress within a given run, it is not a significant indicator of Cstress and fatigue during recreational alpine skiing. However, the cumulative stress variables and LA can be used in field testing of skiers. It is suggested that LA is a practical on-hill marker of chronic stress.","J Strength Cond Res","Journal of strength and conditioning research","23","3","698-704","2025-11-04 11:45:07","2025-11-04 11:45:07"

FSF and ESF for the time period preceding SU were measured. FSF and ESF were both significantly associated with SU. FSF had a greater impact on the use of most substances than did ESF. The FSF with the strongest association with SU was lack of parental monitoring. Regarding ESF, the cumulative number of stressful external events had a higher impact on SU than previous physical or sexual assault by a stranger.

They were then solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulphate, boiled, reduced and the lysate separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both 3H and 125I-radiolabelled ligands bound to a 16 kDa band, to be defined although a much clearer and obviously unequivocal signal was obtained with 3H-labelled histamine. This molecule migrated with the same mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 16 kDa subunit which had been purified on a histamine affinity column from Triton X-100 solubilized mononuclear cells, indicating it to be the ligand-binding subunit for the histamine receptor on these cells. For 3H, fluorography with Entensify was required to obtain an autoradiographic signal. Although 3H took much longer to give a signal than 125I, the considerable background, artefacts and heavy lane trailing seen with [125I] histamine were completely abrogated when [3H]histamine was used. In addition, the distinction between specific and nonspecific binding was more clearly seen using [3H]histamine. The modifications reported here which improve signal detection for 3H should encourage the use of tritiated ligands in radioreceptor crosslinking, particularly those of low molecular weight which might otherwise undergo steric modification due to iodination, this having the potential for interfering with receptor ligand binding.","Electrophoresis","Electrophoresis","11","6","495-9","2025-11-04 11:45:21","2025-11-04 11:45:21"

The higher frequency of obesity in women than in men under Li treatment, suggests a role for reproductive hormones. The serum levels of the following hormones were evaluated in healthy young women at diverse stages of a control menstrual cycle, and during Li carbonate (900 mg/day) or placebo administration: prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, 17-1 estradiol, progesterone, thyroxine, thyrotropin, cortisol, dehidroepiandrosterone sulfate, free testosterone, leptin and an oral glucose tolerance test, in order to measure the areas under the glucose and insulin curve. The body weight was assessed the day before and the last day of treatment. The Li serum levels 15 hours after the last dose were 0.31 +/- 0.1 mEq/L. No significant changes in body weight and in the normal fluctuations of the reproductive hormones along the menstrual cycle were observed during Li administration. An increase in the serum levels of thyrotropic hormone ( p = 0.0001) was the only significant effect of Li, which may predispose to excessive weight gain after prolonged administration of the cation. The remarkable lack of effects of Li on these hormones, question the pertinence of studies conducted in healthy volunteers for the comprehension of the obesity observed in psychiatric patients who may be particularly prone to gain weight under prolonged treatment with high dose of Li.","Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","24","1","1-16","2025-11-04 11:45:23","2025-11-04 11:45:23"

Due to genetic, pathological and symptomatic overlap, ALS is now considered a spectrum disease together with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second most common cause of dementia in individuals under the age of 65. Interestingly, in both diseases, there is a large prevalence of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are mutated and considered disease-causing, or whose dysfunction contribute to disease pathogenesis. The most common shared genetic mutation in ALS/FTD is a hexanucleuotide repeat expansion within intron 1 of C9ORF72 (C9). Three potentially overlapping, putative toxic mechanisms have been proposed: loss of function due to haploinsufficient expression of the C9ORF72 mRNA, gain of function of the repeat RNA aggregates, or RNA foci, and repeat-associated non-ATG-initiated translation (RAN) of the repeat RNA into toxic dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Regardless of the causative mechanism, disease symptoms are ultimately caused by a failure of neurotransmission in three regions: the brain, the spinal cord, and the neuromuscular junction. Here, we review C9 ALS/FTD-associated synaptic dysfunction and aberrant neuronal excitability in these three key regions, focusing on changes in morphology and synapse formation, excitability, and excitotoxicity in patients, animal models, and in vitro models. We compare these deficits to those seen in other forms of ALS and FTD in search of shared pathways, and discuss the potential targeting of synaptic dysfunctions for therapeutic intervention in ALS and FTD patients.","Brain Res","Brain research","1693","Pt A","98-108","2025-11-04 11:45:33","2025-11-04 11:45:33"

The cagA gene product CagA is injected into gastric epithelial cells and disturbs cellular functions by physically interacting with and deregulating a variety of cellular signaling molecules. RUNX3 is a tumor suppressor in many tissues, and it is frequently inactivated in gastric cancer. In this study, we show that H. pylori infection inactivates the gastric tumor suppressor RUNX3 in a CagA-dependent manner. CagA directly associates with RUNX3 through a specific recognition of the PY motif of RUNX3 by a WW domain of CagA. Deletion of the WW domains of CagA or mutation of the PY motif in RUNX3 abolishes the ability of CagA to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of RUNX3, thereby extinguishing its ability to inhibit the transcriptional activation of RUNX3. Our studies identify RUNX3 as a novel cellular target of H. pylori CagA and also reveal a mechanism by which CagA functions as an oncoprotein by blocking the activity of gastric tumor suppressor RUNX3.","Oncogene","Oncogene","29","41","5643-50","2025-11-04 11:45:37","2025-11-04 11:45:37"

The parasite was first detected in the mussels by PCR in early July and by histology in late August. By then, M. pararefringens had developed into mature stages, indicating a rapid development during mid-summer. Sporulation occurred during autumn. Mussels deployed in October never became infected, indicating that transmission was restricted to the warmest period of the year. Pronounced pathology was observed in infected mussels, including degenerated digestive tubules and infiltration of haemocytes. Mussel mortality was observed in the baskets, but whether this was due to infections of M. pararefringens or other environmental factors could not be determined. Plankton samples from the lagoon were also collected for PCR analysis. These samples, dominated by copepods, were positive for M. pararefringens in summer. In sorted samples, M. pararefringens was detected in the Acartia spp. and Paracartia grani fractions between July and October.

We hypothesized that movement symmetry would improve over time across both groups but more so among the SAPP + PERT group. Thirty-nine female athletes 3-9 months after primary ACLR were randomized to SAPP or SAPP + PERT training. Biomechanical testing during overground walking occurred before (Pre-training) and after (Post-training) training and one and 2 years post-operatively. Hip and knee kinematic and kinetic variables were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc comparisons (α = 0.05). There was a time by limb interaction effect (p = 0.028) for peak knee flexion angle (PKFA), the primary outcome which powered the study, characterized by smaller PKFA in the involved compared to uninvolved limbs across treatment groups at Pre-training, Post-training, and 1 year, but not 2 years. Similar findings occurred across sagittal plane knee excursions and kinetics and hip extension excursion at midstance. There were no meaningful interactions involving group. Neither SAPP nor SAPP + PERT training improved walking mechanics, which persisted 1 but not 2 years after ACLR. Statement of clinical significance: Asymmetrical movement patterns persisted long after participants achieved symmetrical strength and functional performance, suggesting more time is needed to recover fully after ACLR. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

BRCA1 is phosphorylated by Chk2 kinase upon γ-irradiation, but the role of Chk2 phosphorylation is not understood. Here, we report that abrogation of Chk2 phosphorylation on BRCA1 delays end resection and the dispersion of BRCA1 from DSBs but does not affect the assembly of Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 (MRN) and CtIP at DSBs. Moreover, we show that BRCA1 is ubiquitinated by SCF(Skp2) and that abrogation of Chk2 phosphorylation impairs its ubiquitination. Our study suggests that BRCA1 is more than a scaffold protein to assemble HR repair proteins at DSBs, but that Chk2 phosphorylation of BRCA1 also serves as a built-in clock for HR repair of DSBs. BRCA1 is known to inhibit Mre11 nuclease activity. SCF(Skp2) activity appears at late G1 and peaks at S/G2, and is known to ubiquitinate phosphodegron motifs. The removal of BRCA1 from DSBs by SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation terminates BRCA1-mediated inhibition of Mre11 nuclease activity, allowing for end resection and restricting the initiation of HR to the S/G2 phases of the cell cycle.","Cell Cycle","Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","14","3","437-48","2025-11-04 11:45:40","2025-11-04 11:45:40"

When returned to nutrient rich conditions these cultures regain their green colour. The aim of this study was to verify whether the cells in these cultures could be considered resting stages allowing the survival of periods of nutrient starvation as has been reported for Synechococcus PCC 7942. The experiments with Microcystis were carried out in parallel with Synechococcus cultures to rule out the possibility that any results obtained with Microcystis were due to our particular experimental conditions. The results of the experiments with Synechococcus PCC 7942 cultures were comparable to the reported in the literature. For Microcystis PCC 7806 a different response was observed. Analysis of chlorotic Microcystis cultures by flow cytometry showed that the phenotype of the cells in the population was not homogenous: the amount of nucleic acids was about the same in all cells but only around one percent of the population emitted red autofluorescence indicating the presence of chlorophyll. Monitoring of the reversion of chlorosis by flow cytometry showed that the re-greening was most likely the result of the division of the small population of red autofluorescent cells originally present in the chlorotic cultures. This assumption was confirmed by analysing the integrity of the DNA and the membrane permeability of the cells of chlorotic cultures. Most of the DNA of these cultures was degraded and only the autofluorescent population of the chlorotic cultures showed membrane integrity. Thus, contrary to what has been reported for other cyanobacterial genera, most of the cells in chlorotic Microcystis cultures are not resting stages but dead. It is interesting to note that the red autofluorescent cells of green and chlorotic cultures obtained in double strength ASM-1 medium differ with respect to metabolism: levels of emission of red autofluorescence are higher in the cells of green cultures and the ability to convert fluorescein diacetate of these cells are heterogeneous when compared to the autofluorescent cells of chlorotic cultures. Thus, the small population of the red autofluorescent cells of chlorotic cultures are in a differentiated metabolic state that allow them to persist in conditions in which most of the population loses viability; persistent cells can be detected in chlorotic cultures maintained for more than a year.","PLoS One","PloS one","10","7","e0133075","2025-11-04 11:45:43","2025-11-04 11:45:43"

PEDV can also cause diarrhea, agalactia, and abnormal reproductive cycles in pregnant sows. Although PEDV was first identified in Europe, it has resulted in significant economic losses in many Asian swine-raising countries, including Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. However, from April 2013 to the present, major outbreaks of PEDV have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Moreover, intercontinental transmission of PEDV has increased mortality rates in seronegative neonatal piglets, resulting in 10% loss of the US pig population. The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV indicates that the virus is able to evade current vaccine strategies. Continuous emergence of multiple mutant strains from several regions has aggravated porcine epidemic diarrhea endemic conditions and highlighted the need for new vaccines based on the current circulating PEDV. Epidemic PEDV strains tend to be more pathogenic and cause increased death in pigs, thereby causing substantial financial losses for swine producers. In this review, we described the epidemiology of PEDV in several countries and present molecular characterization of current strains. We also discuss PEDV vaccines and related issues.","Clin Exp Vaccine Res","Clinical and experimental vaccine research","4","2","166-76","2025-11-04 11:45:45","2025-11-04 11:45:45"

Intramucosal carcinoma do not have a risk of lymph node metastases. However, there is an about 10% risk of lymph node metastases among carcinomas showing submucosal invasion (sm carcinoma). When risk factors revealed to be positive after polypectomy, subsequent surgical resection of the large bowel with lymph nodes dissection is needed, because these sm carcinomas are considered to have a high risk of lymph node metastases. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of depth of invasion is essential to prevent subsequent surgical resection following endoscopic polypectomy. Endoscopy, barium enema and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) are all considered to be effective for an accurate diagnosis of depth of invasion. Endoscopic polypectomy includes hot biopsy, snare polypectomy and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Appropriate maneuver must be chosen, considering the characteristics of the lesion. Major complications after endoscopic polypectomy are bleeding and perforation of the large bowel.

Articles published in English were independently screened for the title and abstracts, and then for full texts. Out of 17 studies included, a significant relationship between the intake of maternal carbohydrate or its subcomponents and neonatal birth weight was reported in six studies. Of them, one study reported that higher carbohydrate intake in early pregnancy was associated with lower birth weight. The two other studies reported a positive correlation between maternal carbohydrate intake and neonatal birth weight regarding first- and second-trimester intake. Maternal carbohydrate intake may have an impact on birth weight, as suggested by the included studies in this systematic review. However, the overall review indicates contradictory findings concerning the relationship between carbohydrate intake and neonatal birth weight.

Here, in Japanese macaques and humans, we examined visual searching for a face and explored what factors contribute to efficient facial information processing. Subjects were asked to search for an odd target among the different numbers of distracters. Faces of the subjects' own species, the backs of the head of the subjects' own species, faces of the subjects' closely related species or race, and faces of species that are clearly different from the subjects' own species were used as the target. Both the macaques and humans detected a face of their own species more efficiently than a face from a clearly different species. Similar efficient detections were confirmed for the faces of the subjects' closely related species or race. These results suggest that conspecific faces and faces that share morphological similarity with conspecific faces can be detected efficiently among non-face objects by both humans and Japanese macaques. In another experiment, facial recognition efficiency was observed when the subjects searched for own-species faces that had lower-spatial-frequency components compared to faces with higher-spatial-frequency components. It seems reasonable that the ability to search efficiently for faces by using holistic face processing is derived from fundamental social cognition abilities that are broadly shared among species.","Anim Cogn","Animal cognition","21","1","155-164","2025-11-04 11:45:47","2025-11-04 11:45:47"

This loss of RGC responsiveness was not associated with substantial changes in the level of N-CAM expression on RGC growth cones. The neurite outgrowth response from E6 RGCs could be inhibited by removal of N-CAM from the monolayer, by removal of alpha 2-8-linked polysialic acid from neuronal N-CAM, or by antibodies that bind exclusively to chick (neuronal) N-CAM. In contrast, the response was not dependent on neuronal beta 1 integrin function.

Several KASH protein genes were discovered as mutant alleles in model organisms with defects in developmentally regulated nuclear positioning. Recently, KASH-less isoforms have been found that connect the cytoskeleton to organelles other than the nucleus. A widened view of these proteins is now emerging, where KASH proteins and their KASH-less counterparts are cargo-specific adaptors that not only link organelles to the cytoskeleton but also regulate developmentally specific organelle movements.","Bioessays","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology","27","11","1136-46","2025-11-04 11:45:51","2025-11-04 11:45:51"

Guidelines which are only centered on clinical topics like diagnoses, treatments etc. are not sufficient to support action and decision in general practice. The article proposes the concept of generic guidelines (basic guidelines) for family medicine. A need for basic guidelines in general practice is established in three areas: 1) cross sectional patient problems (e.g. care for immigrants, common strain and distress, counselling of screening procedures), 2) basic skills and strategies in family practice (e.g. problem-oriented consultation, home visits, patient information and informed consent), and 3) practice management and documentation. The development of generic guidelines seems to be difficult as the efforts to evidence-based professional practice are only recently started, but this is matched by the high importance of guidance for general practice, and certain concepts of family medicine support it. It is concluded that the development of basic guidelines in general practice will have a considerable impact on structuring the framework and fostering the quality improvement of general practice.","Z Arztl Fortbild Qualitatssich","Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung und Qualitatssicherung","95","6","435-42","2025-11-04 11:45:52","2025-11-04 11:45:52"

Interproton distances derived from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement (2D NOE) experiments, using the iterative complete relaxation matrix algorithm MARDIGRAS, and torsion angles for sugar rings, estimated from stimulated fitting of double-quantum-filtered correlation (2QF-COSY) spectra, were obtained [Mujeeb, A., Kerwin, S. M., Egan, W. M., Kenyon, G. L., & James, T. L. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 9325-38]. These structural restraints have now been employed as the basis for structure refinement using restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) to search conformational space for structures consistent with the experimental restraints. Specifically, upper and lower bounds on the restraints were incorporated into the AMBER (version 4.0) total potential energy function of the system, the bounds being used to define the width of a flat-well penalty term in the AMBER force field. Confidence in the time-averaged structure obtained is engendered by convergence to essentially the same structure (root-mean-square deviation approximately 0.9 A) when two quite different DNA models, A-DNA and B-DNA (RMSD approximately 6.5 A), were employed as starting structures and when various initial trajectories were used for the rMD runs. The derived structure is further supported by the total energy calculated, the restraint violation energy, the restraint deviations, and the fit with experimental data. For the latter, the sixth-root residual index indicated a good fit of the determined structure with experimental 2D NOE spectral intensities (R1x < 0.07), and the RMS difference between vicinal proton coupling constants calculated for the derived structure and experimental coupling constants were also in reasonable agreement (JRMS = 0.9 Hz). While the structure of the trisdecamer is basically in the B-DNA family, some structural parameters manifest interesting local variations. The helix parameters indicate that, compared with classical B-DNA, the structure is longitudinally more compressed. Local structural variations at the two TG steps in particular together create bending into the major groove of the duplex. Comparison of the two-CTTG-tetrads in the duplex reveals that they have similar structures, with the TT moieties being almost identical; however, the -CTTG-pur sequence has a larger roll and slide for the -TG- step than for the -CTTG-pyr sequence, in accord with published X-ray crystallographic conclusions.","Biochemistry","Biochemistry","32","49","13419-31","2025-11-04 11:45:53","2025-11-04 11:45:53"

In the treatment of deferoxamine, chelating agent for iron and other metals, to reduce the bleomycin induced free radical production, parallel to decrease the lipid-derived free radical production by deferoxamine, pathophysiological findings of lung injuries were improved by deferoxamine. In conclusion, this is a first paper of in vivo direct evidence of production of free radical from bleomycin-induced lung injury. It is suggested that this method may be used in many kinds of lung disease models, which have potentials of free radical production to cause lung damage.","Biol Pharm Bull","Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin","31","10","1855-9","2025-11-04 11:46:00","2025-11-04 11:46:00"

We have employed a new fatty-acid tracer [9,10-3H]-(R)-2-bromopalmitate (3H-R-BrP) to study individual-tissue nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) uptake in states with diminished or enhanced lipid oxidation. 3H-R-BrP was administered to conscious male Wistar rats (approximately 300 g) during fasting (5, 18, or 36 h), acute blockade of beta-oxidation (etomoxir, 15 micromol/kg), and insulin infusion (0.25 U x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Estimates of NEFA clearance rates (K(f)*) and absolute rates of uptake (R(f)*) were calculated from tissue accumulation of 3H-R-BrP products. In the basal state, NEFA uptake was dependent on the oxidative capacity of tissues: R(f)* in brown adipose tissue (BAT) > heart (HRT) > diaphragm (DPHM) > red quadriceps (RQ) > white quadriceps (WQ) > white adipose tissue (WAT). Fasting increased (P < 0.001) K(f)* in WAT but did not change NEFA clearance in other tissues. However, plasma NEFA levels were raised (P < 0.01), tending to elevate R(f)* in most tissues (P < 0.05: WAT, BAT, WQ, DPHM). Etomoxir reduced (P < 0.01) K(f)* only in oxidative tissues (BAT, RQ, DPHM, HRT). Insulin lowered plasma NEFA levels (P < 0.001) and significantly decreased R(f)* in most tissues (P < 0.05: WAT, RQ, DPHM, HRT). An increased (P < 0.05) clearance was observed in WAT, BAT, and WQ; a decrease (P < 0.01) in K(f)* was observed in HRT. This study is the first to measure tissue-specific NEFA uptake in conscious rats in the postabsorptive, fasted, and insulin-stimulated states. We have demonstrated that tissue NEFA utilization is not exclusively determined by systemic availability, but that the early steps of NEFA uptake or metabolic sequestration can also be rapidly modulated by local processes such as NEFA oxidation.","Diabetes","Diabetes","49","9","1427-33","2025-11-04 11:46:01","2025-11-04 11:46:01"

The L-T ultrasonic measurements were performed in two perpendicular directions using two focused transducers with a 15 MHz center frequency in a pitch-catch configuration. The root mean square (RMS) of ultrasonic scattering was calculated for each L-T measurement and a Gaussian function was used to fit each RMS to determine the RMS amplitude. The ratio of RMS amplitudes for L-T measurements performed in two perpendicular directions was calculated to characterize the microstructural anisotropy on the measured surface of a sample. The results show that the amplitude of L-T ultrasonic scattering is highly dependent on the microstructural anisotropy. The microstructural isotropy was considered on the x-y planes of all samples, while the high anisotropy was seen on the x-z and y-z planes of all low-scattering and high-scattering samples. In addition, the microstructural anisotropy measured on the x-z planes of the low-scattering and high-scattering samples gradually increases and decreases, respectively, from the outside diameter (OD) to the centerline (CL) of the billet. The anisotropy measured on the y-z planes of the low-scattering samples slightly decreases and then increases towards the center, while the anisotropy measured on the y-z planes of the high-scattering samples continuously increases towards the center. The variation of microstructural anisotropy in the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V billet with duplex microstructure was quantified with the L-T ultrasonic method and the results agree well with micrographs shown in Ref. [18]. The mode-converted ultrasonic scattering method provides a NDE method to characterize microstructural anisotropy, which can be used as an NDE tool for quality control.","Ultrasonics","Ultrasonics","119","N/A","106633","2025-11-04 11:46:02","2025-11-04 11:46:02"

The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of neutral stored mucin in the rat small intestine by using morphometric techniques and once established, to verify that this methodology could detect secretion in animals exposed to a known mucin secretagogue. Twelve male Wistar rats (five baseline, five pilocarpine-treated, and two vehicle controls) were fixed by vascular perfusion. After a brief fixation the intestine was removed, cut into 10 equal segments, sliced, and fixed overnight. Methacrylate sections from each segment were stained with periodic acid-Schiff and toluidine blue. For morphometry, the volume of epithelium per surface area of epithelial basal lamina was calculated with a Merz grid. The volume density of stored mucin per epithelium was determined by point-counting on a square lattice grid. Volumes were related to either surface area of epithelial basal lamina or mucosal surface area. Due mostly to contributions by villus stored mucin, the total amount of product was found to increase proximally to distally in the small bowel, with the most dramatic increases occurring in the first three segments. When subjected to pilocarpine, a massive secretory response was evoked, resulting in a near total depletion of crypt stored mucin at all levels of the small bowel. Secretion of villus stored mucin also occurred throughout the small intestine, however reaching levels of significance at only a few points. This study describes the distribution of stored mucin in the small intestine under baseline and accelerated secretory conditions.","Anat Rec","The Anatomical record","229","2","219-26","2025-11-04 11:46:06","2025-11-04 11:46:06"

Blood samples were obtained from the animals just before transport and daily for 17 days after installation in the fattening farm. On each occasion a group of ten animals (170 animals in total) was sampled. The levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in serum were measured as antiviral activity in a cytopathic effect inhibition assay. Beginning at day 4 after installation, a significant proportion of sera contained IFN-alpha, with the highest incidence of IFN-alpha positive animals (25%) and IFN-alpha titers on days 5-10. This indicates a high frequency of viral infections in the animals. The in vitro ability of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMCs) to produce IFN-alpha after stimulation by glutaraldehyde-fixed pseudorabies virus-infected PK15 cells and their proliferative response to the T-cell mitogen leukoagglutinin (LA) was also monitored. There was a significant, but moderate decrease in the ability of PBMCs to produce IFN-alpha during the observation period. In contrast, the response to the mitogen LA decreased markedly during the first 5 days, and thereafter remained at the same low level. The proliferative response to LA was significantly lower for PBMCs from serum of IFN-alpha-positive than from IFN-alpha-negative animals. These impaired PBMC responses could indicate a stress-induced immune depression, possibly contributing to the high incidence of viral infections.","Vet Immunol Immunopathol","Veterinary immunology and immunopathology","23","3-4","345-53","2025-11-04 11:46:06","2025-11-04 11:46:06"

However, to date, design principles that underlie the robustness of natural oscillators are not completely known. Here we study a three-component enzymatic network model in order to determine the topological requirements for robust oscillation. First, by simulating every possible topological arrangement and varying their parameter values, we demonstrate that robust oscillators can be obtained by augmenting the number of both negative feedback loops and positive autoregulations while maintaining an appropriate balance of positive and negative interactions. We then identify network motifs, whose presence in more complex topologies is a necessary condition for obtaining oscillatory responses. Finally, we pinpoint a series of simple architectural patterns that progressively render more robust oscillators. Together, these findings can help in the design of more reliable synthetic biomolecular networks and may also have implications in the understanding of other oscillatory systems.","Syst Synth Biol","Systems and synthetic biology","9","3","125-33","2025-11-04 11:46:08","2025-11-04 11:46:08"

Diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was based on a typical medical history, the characteristic result of a fluid restriction test, the lack of an effect of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine (DDAVP) on both urine osmolality and plasma coagulation factors and, finally, the detection of a hemizygous missense mutation within the arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor gene. Hydrochlorothiazide treatment and dietary measures reduced the patient's urine volume to one third of its original volume. However, this had no effect on enuresis. The daily intranasal application of DDAVP did not further reduce urine output but dramatically decreased the frequency of bed wetting. This observation contradicts the common notion that the therapeutic effect of DDAVP in nocturnal enuresis is the result of compensation for a nocturnal AVP deficit. Rather, it points to a different mode of action of DDAVP in patients with enuresis. It is hypothesised that central AVP receptors are a target of DDAVP and that they might play an important role in the pathogenesis of nocturnal enuresis.","Arch Dis Child","Archives of disease in childhood","81","1","57-9","2025-11-04 11:46:10","2025-11-04 11:46:10"

This provides a measure of the translocation relevance of each form of SecA membrane association. We now report that azide acts exclusively on SecA that is cycling at SecYEG and has no effect on SecA lipid associations. SecA molecules recovered with sucrose gradient-purified inner membrane vesicles (""endogenous"" SecA) support translocation at the same rate as ""added"" SecA molecules bound at SecYEG.

These synapses, formed by axons of: (1) CA3 pyramidal neurons; (2) neurons of the entorhinal cortex (EC); and (3) neighboring CA1 neurons, are all potentially plastic. Here, we take advantage of the accessibility of the organotypic slice preparation to identify the type of spines with which each of these pathways forms synapses, at different developmental stages. Recent reports have shown that morphology of dendritic spines is activity-dependent with large mushroom spines being thought to represent stronger synaptic connections than thin or stubby spines. Although in a wide range of preparations, mushroom spines represent only 15% of spines across the whole dendritic tree, we find that this proportion is highly pathway specific. Thus in organotypic slices, the axons of CA3 neurons form synapses with mushroom spines on CA1 neurons in approximately 50% of cases, whereas this spine type is rare (<10%) in either of the other two pathways. This high proportion of mushroom spines only occurs after spontaneous excitatory activity in the CA1 cells increases over the second week in vitro. Previous studies suggest that pathway specificity also occurs in vivo. In tissue fixed in vivo, it is the synapses of distal apical dendrites thought to be formed by axons originating in the EC that are richer in mushroom spines. Hence, contrary to previous suggestions, the proportion of mushroom spines is clearly not an intrinsic property of the pathway but rather a characteristic dependent on the environment. We suggest that this is most likely a result of the previous activity of the synapses. The fact that, despite the large differences in pathway specificity between preparations, the overall proportion of different spine types remains unchanged, suggests a strong influence of homeostasis across the network.","Hippocampus","Hippocampus","16","12","1111-24","2025-11-04 11:46:16","2025-11-04 11:46:16"

Few studies, however, have examined the processes whereby supportive parenting lessens this effect and the progression of mental health and physical health symptoms in adolescence. The present study investigates the influences of chronic family economic hardship on adolescents' multiple health problem symptoms (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, and depression and physical complaints) through parents' marital conflict, and supportive parenting; it also examines how there adolescents' health problems mutually influence one another throughout adolescence. We used Structural Equation Modeling to analyze data from a longitudinal sample of European American mothers, fathers, and target adolescents (N = 451, 53% female) to examine direct and indirect effects. Findings generally supported the hypothesized model. Chronic family economic hardship contributed to mental and physical health problems of adolescents. This influence largely was mediated through supportive parenting. Moreover, supportive parenting buffered marital conflict on depressive symptoms of adolescents. Also, there was a tendency for females to show more stable depressive symptoms than males. The study demonstrates key mediating pathways and additional moderating influences based on the family stress model and also highlights the importance of improving health resources for adolescents.","J Youth Adolesc","Journal of youth and adolescence","42","6","821-36","2025-11-04 11:46:24","2025-11-04 11:46:24"

Glycation is associated with both normal aging and diabetes and has been shown to increase arterial stiffness. In this study we examined the direct effect of glycation on the mechanical response of intact arteries and on the mechanical response and structure of elastin isolated from the arteries. Samples of intact arteries and isolated elastin were prepared from porcine aortas and glycated. The mechanical response of all samples was completed using a uniaxial material test system. Glycation levels were measured using ELISA. A confocal microscope was used to image differences in the structure of the glycated and untreated elastin fibers. We found that, under the conditions used in this study, glycation led to decreased stiffness of elastin isolated from arteries, which was associated with a thinning of elastin fibers as imaged by confocal microscopy. We observed no effect of glycation on collagen fibers under our treatment conditions. These results suggest that glycation leads to weakening of the elastin component of arteries that could contribute to vascular defects seen in diabetes and aging. Prevention of glycation reactions may be an important consideration for vascular health later in life.","J Biomed Mater Res A","Journal of biomedical materials research.

However, a general mechanistic or neurophysiological understanding of cage stereotypies has proved elusive. In contrast, stereotypies in human mental disorder, or those induced by drugs or brain lesions, are well understood, and are thought to result from the disinhibition of behavioural selection by the basal ganglia. In this study, we found that the cage stereotypies of captive bank voles also correlate with signs of altered response selection by the basal ganglia. Stereotypic bar-mouthing in the caged voles correlated with inappropriate responding in extinction learning, impairments of response timing, evidence of a knowledge-action dissociation, increased rates of behavioural activation, and hyperactivity. Furthermore, all these signs intercorrelated, implicating a single underlying deficit consistent with striatal disinhibition of response selection. Bar-mouthing thus appears fundamentally similar to the stereotypies of autists, schizophrenics, and subjects treated with amphetamine or basal ganglial lesions. These results represent the first evidence for a neural substrate of cage stereotypy. They also suggest that stereotypic animals may experience novel forms of psychological distress, and that stereotypy might well represent a potential confound in many behavioural experiments.","Behav Brain Res","Behavioural brain research","136","1","83-92","2025-11-04 11:46:26","2025-11-04 11:46:26"

Epidemiological data indicate sex differences regarding cardiometabolic disorders and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study aimed to describe biometric, nutritional and cardiovascular changes related to neonatal overweight promoted by litter size reduction in young and adult Wistar rats of both sexes. Litter adjustment to eight or four pups/mother (1:1 male-to-female ratio) gave, respectively, control and overweight groups. Body mass, food intake, haemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters and cardiorespiratory capacity were evaluated at postnatal days 30 and 150. Diminished litters were correlated with higher body mass and weight gain (12 %) during lactation, validating the experimental model of neonatal overweight. Soon after weaning male (16 %) and female (25 %) offspring of these litters presented a lower food intake than their respective control, without differences in body mass. Adult males from reduced litters presented higher abdominal circumference (7 %), systolic blood pressure (10 %), interventricular septum thickness (15 %) and relative wall thickness (15 %) compared with their respective control. Rats' performance on the maximal effort ergometer test was not affected by neonatal overweight. Data suggest the occurrence of catch-down growth and hypophagia in male and female rats submitted to neonatal overweight. However, only male rats presented haemodynamic and cardiac structural changes.

The fusion proteins differed with respect to TNF receptor type (p55 or p75 TNF receptor), receptor valency (one, two or four receptor domains per molecule), the presence or absence of a CH1 domain in the IgG constant region, and the proportion of the extracellular domain included in the construct. In vitro TNF binding assays and cytotoxicity assays indicated that, of the constructs that bound TNF, the greatest difference in affinity and neutralizing capability was between monovalent and bivalent receptor constructs. Differences were also noted between tetravalent and bivalent versions of p55 fusion proteins, as well as between a p75 fusion protein comprising the complete extracellular domain and one lacking the C-terminal 53 amino acids of the extracellular domain. p55 constructs that included only the second cysteine-rich domain (CRD) or only the second and third CRDs showed no TNF binding activity. The presence or absence of an IgG CH1 domain made no difference in the ability of fusion proteins to neutralize TNF-alpha or TNF-beta. Animal experiments comparing the tetravalent and bivalent p55 fusions and the effects of the CH1 domain did not show significant differences in their ability to protect mice from endotoxin-induced lethality, although the p55 fusion proteins appeared to be more protective than the p75 fusion proteins. Thus, this study has identified structural modifications to TNF receptor/IgG fusion proteins which have differing effects on their neutralizing ability towards TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.","Cytokine","Cytokine","7","8","759-70","2025-11-04 11:46:29","2025-11-04 11:46:29"

Peroxide-dependent oxidation of cysteines induces conformational changes that alter the ability for protein-protein interactions. For regeneration, 2-CysPRXs withdraw electrons from thioredoxins (TRXs) and participate in redox-dependent regulation by affecting the redox state of TRX-dependent targets, for example, in chloroplast metabolism. This work explores the redox conformation-specific 2-CysPRX interactome using an affinity-based pull down with recombinant variants arrested in specific quaternary conformations. This allowed us to address a critical and poorly explored aspect of the redox-regulatory network and showed that the interaction of TRXs, their interaction partners, and 2-CysPRX occur under contrasting redox conditions. A set of 178 chloroplast proteins were identified from leaf proteins and included proteins with functions in photosynthesis, carbohydrate, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, and defense. These processes are known to be deregulated in plants devoid of 2-CysPRX. Selected enzymes like LIPOXYGENASE 2, CHLOROPLAST PROTEIN 12-1, CHORISMATE SYNTHASE, ß-CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, and FERREDOXIN-dependent GLUTAMATE SYNTHASE 1 were subjected to far Western, isothermal titration calorimetry, and enzyme assays for validation. The pull down fractions frequently contained TRXs as well as their target proteins, for example, FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE and MALATE DEHYDROGENASE. The difference between TRX-dependent indirect interactions of TRX targets and 2-CysPRX and direct 2-CysPRX binding is hypothesized to be related to quaternary structure formation, where 2-CysPRX oligomers function as scaffold for complex formation, whereas TRX oxidase activity of 2-CysPRX controls the redox state of TRX-related enzyme activity.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)","9","6","N/A","2025-11-04 11:46:33","2025-11-04 11:46:33"

Analogs of NAD+, deamino-NAD+ and nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide served as coenzymes. Initial-velocity and product inhibition studies suggested that the deamination of L-alanine proceeded through a sequential ordered binary-ternary mechanism. NAD+ bound first to the enzyme, followed by L-alanine, and the products were released in the order of ammonia, pyruvate, and NADH. The Km were 0.47 mM for L-alanine, 0.16 mM for NAD+, 0.22 mM for pyruvate, 0.067 mM for NADH, and 66.7 mM for ammonia. The Km for L-alanine was the smallest in the alanine dehydrogenases studied so far. The enzyme gene was cloned into Escherichia coli JM109 cells and the nucleotides were sequenced.

A Lead⁻Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) spallation target will be installed in the target test facility and bombarded by pulsed proton beams (250 kW, 400 MeV, 25 Hz, and 0.5 ms pulse duration). To realize the LBE spallation target, cavitation damage due to pressure changes in the liquid metal should be determined, preliminarily, because such damage is considered to be very critical, from the viewpoint of target safety and lifetime. In this study, cavitation damage due to pressure waves caused by pulsed proton beam injection and turbulent liquid metal flow, were studied, numerically, from the viewpoint of single cavitation bubble dynamics. Specifically, the threshold of cavitation and effects of flow speed fluctuation on cavitation bubble dynamics, in an orifice structure, were investigated in the present work. The results showed that the LBE spallation target did not undergo cavitation damage, under normal nominal operation conditions, mainly because of the long pulse duration of the pulsed proton beam and the low liquid metal flow velocity. Nevertheless, the possibility of cavitation damage in the orifice structure, under certain extreme transient LBE flow conditions, cannot be neglected.","Materials (Basel)","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)","12","4","N/A","2025-11-04 11:46:44","2025-11-04 11:46:44"

We detect well-defined, conserved RNA secondary structure elements in the coding regions of the mRNA sequences and show that base-paired codons strongly correlate with sparse codons. We also investigate the role of repetitive elements in the formation of secondary structure and explain the use of alternate start codons in the caveolin-1 gene by a conserved secondary structure element overlapping the nominal start codon. We discuss the functional roles of our novel findings in regulating the gene expression on mRNA level. We also investigate the role of secondary structure on the correct splicing of the human CFTR gene. We study the wild-type version of the pre-mRNA as well as 29 variants with synonymous mutations in exon 12.

Hence, early detection of MI events is critical for effective preventative therapies, potentially reducing avoidable mortality. One approach for early disease prediction is the use of risk prediction models developed using machine learning techniques. One important component of these models is to provide clinicians with the flexibility to customize (e.g., the prediction range) and use the risk prediction model that they deemed most beneficial for their patients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop MI prediction models and investigate the effect of sample age and prediction resolution on the performance of MI risk prediction models. The cardiovascular health study dataset was used in this study. Results indicate that the prediction model developed using SVM algorithm is capable of achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 95.3%, 84.8%, and 90.1%, respectively, over a time span of 6 years. Both sample age and prediction resolution were found not to have a significant impact on the performance of MI risk prediction models developed using subjects aged 65 and above. This implies that risk prediction models developed using different sample age and prediction resolution is a feasible approach. These models can be integrated into a computer aided screening tool which clinicians can use to interpret and predict the MI risk status of the individual patients after performing the necessary clinical assessments (e.g., cognitive function, physical function, electrocardiography, general changes to health/lifestyle, and medications) required by the models. This could offer a means for clinicians to screen the patients at risk of having MI in the near future and prescribe early medical intervention to reduce the risk.","IEEE J Biomed Health Inform","IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics","19","3","1178-85","2025-11-04 11:46:48","2025-11-04 11:46:48"

Previous studies have found large numbers of trans-regulated genes (regulated by unlinked genetic loci) that link to a single locus or eQTL ""hotspot,"" and it would be desirable to find the mechanism of coregulation for these gene groups. However, many difficulties exist with current network reconstruction algorithms such as low power and high computational cost. A common observation for biological networks is that they have a scale-free or power-law architecture. In such an architecture, highly influential nodes exist that have many connections to other nodes. If we assume that this type of architecture applies to genetic networks, then we can simplify the problem of genetic network reconstruction by focusing on discovery of the key regulatory genes at the top of the network. We introduce the concept of ""shielding"" in which a specific gene expression variable (the shielder) renders a set of other gene expression variables (the shielded genes) independent of the eQTL. We iteratively build networks from the eQTL to the shielder down using tests of conditional independence. We have proposed a novel test for controlling the shielder false-positive rate at a predetermined level by requiring a threshold number of shielded genes per shielder. Using simulation, we have demonstrated that we can control the shielder false-positive rate as well as obtain high shielder and edge specificity. In addition, we have shown our method to be robust to violation of the latent variable assumption, an important feature in the practical application of our method. We have applied our method to a yeast expression QTL data set in which microarray and marker data were collected from the progeny of a backcross of two species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brem et al. 2002). Seven genetic networks have been discovered, and bioinformatic analysis of the discovered regulators and corresponding regulated genes has generated plausible hypotheses for mechanisms of regulation that can be tested in future experiments.","Genetics","Genetics","187","3","955-64","2025-11-04 11:46:49","2025-11-04 11:46:49"

The spermatids discard gamma-tubulin in the residual bodies during the spermiation stage. Mature sperm do not have any detectable gamma-tubulin. About half of the centrin associated with the distal centriole degenerates during spermiogenesis and the remainder is intimately bound to the centriolar microtubules.

Most patients with severe disease belong to the elderly age group (<65 years of age) and have multiple associated co-morbidities. The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to suppress overactive immune responses as well as bring about tissue regeneration and repair.

Many test systems have been described and an increasing number of compounds tested. However, the in vivo data basis used for comparison is still heterogeneous and a proper analysis of most in vivo/in vitro correlations is difficult. Some progress has been achieved with various controlled validation programmes on a national and international level, all of which have not been completed. In order to improve this slow progress the following measures are proposed: (1) expectations for a uniform test need to be discouraged when heterogeneous chemical actions may occur, and rigid test guidelines have to be replaced by flexible ones (differentiated approach); (2) many practical small steps need to be taken rather than one theoretical large step, that is by accepting simple in vitro tests for restricted groups of chemicals such as severe irritants (adaptive approach); and (3) the threshold for acceptance of in vitro tests needs to be lowered by regulatory bodies and routine laboratories (optimistic approach).","Toxicol In Vitro","Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA","4","4-5","242-5","2025-11-04 11:47:05","2025-11-04 11:47:05"

To investigate these contributions, multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed to monitor responses of BOLD, cerebral blood flow (CBF), total CBV, and arterial CBV (CBV(a)) in human visual cortex after brief breath hold and visual stimulation. In visual experiments, after stimulus cessation, CBV(a) was restored to baseline in 7.9±3.4 seconds, and CBF and CBV in 14.8±5.0 seconds and 16.1±5.8 seconds, respectively, all significantly faster than BOLD signal recovery after undershoot (28.1±5.5 seconds). During the BOLD undershoot, postarterial CBV (CBV(pa), capillaries and venules) was slightly elevated (2.4±1.8%), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) was above baseline (10.6±7.4%). Following breath hold, however, CBF, CBV, CBV(a) and BOLD signals all returned to baseline in ∼20 seconds. No significant BOLD undershoot, and residual CBV(pa) dilation were observed, and CMRO(2) did not substantially differ from baseline. These data suggest that both delayed CBV(pa) recovery and enduring increased oxidative metabolism impact the BOLD undershoot. Using a biophysical model, their relative contributions were estimated to be 19.7±15.9% and 78.7±18.6%, respectively.","J Cereb Blood Flow Metab","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism","31","7","1599-611","2025-11-04 11:47:07","2025-11-04 11:47:07"

The possibility of malignant degeneration implies the systematic extirpation of any known pre-sacral cyst or tumor. Kraske's trans-sacral approach gives good access to the retro-rectal space.

One of these proteins is Omi/Htra2, a serine protease which inactivates Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). In the present work, we assessed the participation of Omi/Htra2 in the cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) in SW480 colon cancer cells. CDDP and 5-FU induced apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic pathway in colon cancer cells, as demonstrated by morphological analyses, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspase 3. Omi/Htra2 was also released from mitochondria of cells exposed to these drugs, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and western blot assays of subcellular fractions. Exposure of cells to the Omi/Htra2 serine protease inhibitor UCF-101 prevented death p<0.0001 and partially suppressed reproductive cell death of cells exposed to cisplatin p<0.05, but not to 5-FU p=0.49.

Comparing the biomechanical properties to amniotic membrane (AM), the most frequently applied matrix for ocular surface reconstruction today, the decellularised conjunctiva was more extensible and elastic but exhibited less tensile strength. The in vivo application in a rabbit model proofed significantly enhanced transplant stability and less suture losses comparing PDC and HDC to AM while none of the matrices induced considerable inflammation.

The last decade has witnessed many technologic changes in the performance of screening tests for autoantibodies, and an expeditious approach to the detection of the clinically useful autoantibody system has been outlined. When both an immunofluorescent assay using an actively dividing substrate such as HEp-2 and an immunodiffusion test for precipitin autoantibodies are performed on patient sera, it is likely that most of the significant diagnostic and prognostic systems will be detected. Although exact pathogenetic roles have not been defined for all autoantibodies, it is apparent that highly specific markers for certain rheumatic diseases exist and the pertinent clinical aspects of each individual autoantibody-autoantigen system has been summarized. Why so many autoantibodies are cross-reactive with seemingly unrelated antigens is a perplexing aspect of autoimmunity, a disease process for which the necessary and sufficient conditions of development have not been defined even after decades of research. One recent hypothesis regarding the generation of diverse autoantibodies is the tenet that production is interrelated in an auto-anti-idiotypic network. Support for this hypothesis comes from the recent successful use of anti-idiotypes to DNA autoantibodies in an attempt to abrogate pathogenetic effects of target organ damage in murine models of SLE. A similar approach might be undertaken with some of the other autoantibody systems in an attempt at a novel therapy for disorders of immunoregulation.","Ann Allergy","Annals of allergy","55","3","421-33","2025-11-04 11:47:18","2025-11-04 11:47:18"

Specimens were obtained from patients with CD from grossly affected colonic regions, from biopsies obtained from patients with CD treated with mesalazine and from control individuals. Quantitative analysis was made for the changes of the number of nerve terminals and their vesicle contents. The distribution pattern of all immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibers was similar both in the control and in the surgical specimens as well as in the biopsies obtained. The number of the synapses, the IR nerve fibers and their vesicle content were markedly decreased in the grossly affected colonic regions. Some degenerated axons were found in close proximity to the plasma cells. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and somatostatin IR nerve fibers were in direct contact with the plasma cells, lymphocytes and other immunocompetent cells. The gap between the membranes of immunoreactive nerve terminals and immunocompetent cells was 20-200 nm, in a few cases even less. In the mesalazine-treated group the number of the IR nerve terminals as well as their vesicle content was increased. These results suggest that changes in the number of different neuropeptide-containing nerve terminals and their content might alter the neuroimmunological processes, because these peptides are known to be immunoregulators.","Neuroimmunomodulation","Neuroimmunomodulation","4","5-6","250-7","2025-11-04 11:47:20","2025-11-04 11:47:20"

Hence, identifying factors that limit this acquisition may inform preventative and treatment efforts. Personality disorders are characterized by pervasive and enduring dysfunctional interpersonal functioning, including parenting, and could thus entail risk for offspring in not developing adaptive interpersonal skills. However, no study has tested this possibility. A representative sample drawn from two birth cohorts of Norwegian 4-year-olds (n = 956) and their parents was followed up at ages 6, 8, and 10 years. Parents' personality disorder symptoms were measured dimensionally with the DSM-IV and ICD-10 Personality Questionnaire, and children's social skills were evaluated by the Social Skills Rating System. A difference-in-difference approach was applied to adjust for all unmeasured time-invariant confounders, and parental symptoms of depression and anxiety were entered as covariates. Increased Cluster B symptoms in parents of children aged 4 to 6 years predicted decreased social skill development in offspring (B = -0.97, 95% CI -1.58, -0.37, p = 0.002). On a more granular level, increased symptoms of borderline (B = -0.39, CI -0.65, -0.12, p = 0.004), histrionic (B = -0.55, CI -0.99, -0.11, p = 0.018), and avoidant (B = -0.46, CI-0.79, -0.13, p = 0.006) personality disorders in parents predicted decreased social skill development in offspring. Subclinical levels of borderline, histrionic and avoidant personality disorders in parents may impair the development of social skills in offspring. Successfully treating these personality problems or considering them when providing services to children may facilitate children's acquisition of social skills.","Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry","European child & adolescent psychiatry","32","9","1561-1568","2025-11-04 11:47:23","2025-11-04 11:47:23"

Among them, more than 100 oncogenes, 20-30 tumor-suppressor genes, and hundreds of genes participating in DNA repair and replication have been found to play a role in the origins of cancer over the last 25 years. The phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is a critical step in cellular growth and development and is achieved through the tight regulation of protein kinases. Phosphorylation plays a major role in eukaryotic signaling as kinase domains are found in 2% of our genes. The deregulation of kinase control mechanisms has disastrous consequences, often leading to gains of function, cell transformation, and cancer. The c-Abl kinase protein is one of the most studied targets in the fight against cancer and is a hotspot for drug development because it participates in several solid tumors and is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor suppressors have the opposite effects. Their fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has awarded them a role as the guardians of DNA. Among the tumor suppressors, p53 is the most studied. The p53 protein has been shown to be a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to specific DNA response elements and activates gene transcription. Stress triggered by ionizing radiation or other mutagenic events leads to p53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or programed cell death. The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain are classified as class I or class II depending on whether substitutions occur in the DNA contact sites or in the protein core, respectively. Tumor-associated p53 mutations often lead to the loss of protein function, but recent investigations have also indicated gain-of-function mutations. The prion-like aggregation of mutant p53 is associated with loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and gain-of-function effects. In the current review, we focused on the most recent insights into the protein structure and function of the c-Abl and p53 proteins that will provide us guidance to understand the loss and gain of function of these misfolded tumor-associated proteins.","Front Oncol","Frontiers in oncology","5","N/A","97","2025-11-04 11:47:28","2025-11-04 11:47:28"

The bioavailable portion, which comprises the organic contaminants in pore water and the ones bound to organic carbon, was accessed by equilibrium partitioning to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The exhaustive solvent and PDMS extracts were toxicologically characterized with a battery of in vitro reporter gene assays and chemically analyzed with liquid and gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. The bioavailable fractions of mixture effects and individual chemicals were mostly lower than 0.1, indicating that more than 90% of the substances are strongly bound and would not pose an immediate risk but could potentially be remobilized in the long term. Despite 655 organic chemicals analyzed, only 0.1-28% of the observed biological effects was explained by the detected compounds in whole sediments, while 0.009-3.3% was explained by bioavailable chemicals. The mixture effects were not only dominated by legacy pollutants (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the bioassay for activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and oxidative stress response (AREc32)) but also by present-use chemicals (e.g., plastic additives for binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)), with different fingerprints between whole sediments and bioavailable extracts.

The toxicity of an MRTP and the potential molecular mechanisms involved were investigated in high-content screening tests and whole genome transcriptomics analyses using human bronchial epithelial cells. The prototypic (p)MRTP that was tested had less impact than reference cigarette 3R4F on the cellular oxidative stress response and cell death pathways. Higher pMRTP aerosol extract concentrations had impact on pathways associated with the detoxification of xenobiotics and the reduction of oxidative damage. A pMRTP aerosol concentration up to 18 times higher than the 3R4F caused similar perturbation effects in biological networks and led to the perturbation of networks related to cell stress, and proliferation biology. These results may further facilitate the development of a systems toxicology-based impact assessment for use in future risk assessments in line with the 21st century toxicology paradigm, as shown here for an MRTP.","Toxicol In Vitro","Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA","29","8","2102-15","2025-11-04 11:47:31","2025-11-04 11:47:31"

We report on a NTC signaling pathway requiring T-type calcium channels (TTCCs) that is conserved between primitive chordates (Ciona) and Xenopus. With loss of TTCCs, there is a failure to seal the anterior neural folds. Accompanying loss of TTCCs is an upregulation of EphrinA effectors. Ephrin signaling is known to be important in NTC, and ephrins can affect both cell adhesion and repulsion. In Ciona, ephrinA-d expression is downregulated at the end of neurulation, whereas, with loss of TTCC, ephrinA-d remains elevated. Accordingly, overexpression of ephrinA-d phenocopied TTCC loss of function, while overexpression of a dominant-negative Ephrin receptor was able to rescue NTC in a Ciona TTCC mutant. We hypothesize that signaling through TTCCs is necessary for proper anterior NTC through downregulation of ephrins, and possibly elimination of a repulsive signal.","Cell Rep","Cell reports","13","4","829-839","2025-11-04 11:47:34","2025-11-04 11:47:34"

We have now investigated the intracellular mechanisms involved in RVV-stimulated GH release by concomitant administration of RVV with known intracellular mediators in rat pituitary cells. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 0.5 mmol/l), added to cultured rat anterior pituitary cells simultaneously with RVV, at concentrations up to a maximally effective dose of 10 micrograms/ml, increased GH release (3.7-fold, 4.0-fold and 2.0-fold; P less than 0.001) compared with the effect of venom alone. These effects were additive, indicating that RVV and IBMX stimulate through different intracellular messengers. RVV failed to increase the formation of basal or IBMX-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), confirming that RVV affects GH release through a cAMP-independent pathway. 12-0-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 0.1 mumol/l), added simultaneously with various doses of RVV (0.1-10 micrograms/ml), did not increase GH release beyond the maximal effect of RVV. This result indicates that RVV might be stimulating GH release through a similar mechanism to that of TPA (by activating protein kinase C). When pituitary cells were perifused with Ca(2+)-free medium or verapamil (50 mumol/l), RVV-stimulated GH release was inhibited by 65 and 42% respectively.

Patients identifying as White (AOR = 1.23, CI = 1.00-1.50) and Black (AOR = 1.27, CI = 1.02-1.57) had higher odds of hospitalization than other races. When compared to co-occuring hospitalizations in the Midwest, the odds were higher in the Northeast. (AOR = 2.56, CI = 2.07-3.17) Future research should explore the extent to which similar findings occur in the context of mortality and targeted interventions should intesify for subpopulations at highest risk of co-occuring HIV and opioid misuse diagnoses.","Prev Med Rep","Preventive medicine reports","34","N/A","102225","2025-11-04 11:47:39","2025-11-04 11:47:39"

Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixing the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it will lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. A NO depot is designed for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16-tumor-bearing mice, the depot can provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment work in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16 tumors more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.","Adv Mater","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)","34","37","e2202625","2025-11-04 11:47:40","2025-11-04 11:47:40"

Therefore, we investigated the impact of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 activity on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced renal TxA2 formation, and on endotoxemia-induced AKI in mice. Injection of LPS (3 mg/kg ip) decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the amount of thrombocytes to ∼50% of basal values after 4 h. Plasma and renocortical tissue levels of TxB2 were increased ∼10- and 1.7-fold in response to LPS, respectively. The COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 attenuated the LPS-induced fall in GFR and in platelet count to ∼75% of basal levels. Furthermore, SC-560 abolished the increase in plasma and renocortical tissue levels of TxB2 in response to LPS. The COX-2 inhibitor SC-236 further enhanced the LPS-induced decrease in GFR to ∼40% of basal values. SC-236 did not alter thrombocyte levels nor the LPS-induced increase in plasma and renocortical tissue levels of TxB2. Pretreatment with clopidogrel inhibited the LPS-induced drop in thrombocyte count, but did not attenuate the LPS-induced decrease in GFR and the increase in plasma TxB2 levels. This study demonstrates that endotoxemia-induced TxA2 formation depends on the activity of COX-1. Our study further indicates that the COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 has a protective effect on the decrease in renal function in response to endotoxin. Therefore, our data support a role for TxA2 in the development of AKI in response to LPS.","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","American journal of physiology.

Her parents were a consanguineous marriage. At two years of age, she developed night blindness. During her childhood she had severe diarrhea that disappeared in adulthood. At 26 years of age, she was diagnosed as having retinitis pigmentosa and her visual acuity became worse thereafter. She noted tremor in the right hand at 37 years of age, gait ataxia at 42, and developed tremor in the bilateral lower extremities at 48. On admission, bilateral visual disturbance, resting and postural tremor, moderately poor coordination, mild distal dominant sensory impairment, an absence of tendon reflex in all four extremities, moderate to severe gait ataxia, and positive Romberg sign were found. Muscle rigidity and akinesia were not observed. Intelligence and muscle power were normal and pathological reflexes were absent. Acanthocytes were found in blood. Serum chemistry showed remarkable decreases in total cholesterol (54 mg/dl, normal 180-220), triglyceride (0 mg/dl, normal 30-150), beta-lipoprotein (3 mg/dl, normal 190-500), apoA-1 protein (66 mg/dl, normal 105-184), apoA-2 protein (11 mg/dl, normal 26-46), apoB protein (0 mg/dl, normal 38-104), apoC-2 protein (1.1 mg/dl, normal 1.2-6.4), vitamin A (297 ng/ml, normal 431-1,041), and vitamin E (0.19 ng/dl, normal 0.75-1.41). While, a marked increase in PIVKA II (703 mAU/ml, normal<40) due to a decrease in vitamin K was found. She was thus diagnosed as having Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome or hypo-betalipoproteinemia. Although brain MRI was normal, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) showed mildly decreased perfusion in the left parietal cortex and right striatum. Motor nerve conduction velocities were normal, but sensory nerve action potentials were not evoked in all four extremities. Surface EMG recorded on the right radial extensor and flexor carpi muscles at rest showed a 4.5 Hz tremor. Vitamin replacement therapy with vitamin A (10,000 IU/day), E (200 mg/day), and K (10 mg/day) was initiated. Several days after treatment, amplitude of resting tremor ameliorated mildly. Clonazepam was administered (0.5 mg/day) for further treatment. After one-month of treatment, vitamin A (656 ng/ml) and E (0.39 mg/dl) levels were elevated and PIVKA II level (29 mAU/ml) decreased. Only a mild right hand tremor remained, but sensory impairment and gait ataxia were not changed. The cause of Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a deletion of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene. While, familial hypo-betalipoproteinemia, due to a mutation of apolipoprotein B gene, is known to show the same phenotype. Because of the patient's refusal of genetic examination, which disease she has cannot be conclusively determined. Intention tremor was reported in Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome. However, her 4.5 Hz tremor was also present at rest, which resembled resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. Pathophysiology of Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is known to be due to hypo-vitaminosis. Decreased [18F]-dopa uptake in striatum of patients with long-term hypo-vitamin E has been reported in PET study. Mild hypoperfusion was found in the striatum of the present cases: indicating that her tremor was associated with striatonigral damage. Thus, careful observation of extrapyramidal signs is necessary in abeta- or hypo-betalipoproteinemia.","Rinsho Shinkeigaku","Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology","46","10","702-6","2025-11-04 11:47:49","2025-11-04 11:47:49"

It is well known that DPP4 inhibitors exert their antidiabetes effects mainly by inhibiting the enzymatic degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. The anti-inflammatory effect of DPP4 inhibitors was proved by preclinical and clinical studies of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Preclinical data using DPP4 inhibitors-based therapies in studies of nonobese diabetic mice demonstrated additional effects, including immunomodulation, preserving beta-cell mass, promoting beta-cell regeneration and reversing newly diagnosed diabetes. Thus, these data show that DPP4 inhibitors may be effective for type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, their potential clinical benefits for type 1 diabetes remain to be evaluated.

However, in order to realize the directed change or improve their properties, it is necessary to understand the basics of catalysis and the specificity of interactions with substrates. In the present work, a structural and functional study of the Fab fragment of antibody A5 and a comparative analysis of its properties with antibody A17 have been carried out. These antibodies were previously selected for their ability to interact with organophosphorus compounds via covalent catalysis. It has been established that antibody A5 has exceptional specificity for phosphonate X with bimolecular reaction rate constants of 510 ± 20 and 390 ± 20 min^(-1)М^(-1) for kappa and lambda variants, respectively. 3D-Modeling of antibody A5 structure made it possible to establish that the reaction residue L-Y33 is located on the surface of the active site, in contrast to the A17 antibody, in which the reaction residue L-Y37 is located at the bottom of a deep hydrophobic pocket. To investigate a detailed mechanism of the reaction, A5 antibody mutants with replacements L-R51W and H-F100W were created, which made it possible to perform stopped-flow kinetics. Tryptophan mutants were obtained as Fab fragments in the expression system of the methylotrophic yeast species Pichia pastoris. It has been established that the effectiveness of their interaction with phosphonate X is comparable to the wild-type antibody. Using the data of the stopped-flow kinetics method, significant conformational changes were established in the phosphonate modification process. The reaction was found to proceed using the induced-fit mechanism; the kinetic parameters of the elementary stages of the process have been calculated.

Despite having a high capacity to alter the precise target genes and genomic regions that the planned guide RNA (or sgRNA) complements, the off-target effect still exists. But there are already machine learning algorithms for people, animals, and a few plant species. In this paper, an effort has been made to create models based on three machine learning-based techniques [namely, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF)] for the prediction of the CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage sites that will be cleaved by a particular sgRNA. The plant dataset was the sole source of inspiration for all of these machine learning-based algorithms. 70% of the on-target and off-target dataset of various plant species that was gathered was used to train the models. The remaining 30% of the data set was used to evaluate the model's performance using a variety of evaluation metrics, including specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, F2 score, and AUC. Based on the aforementioned machine learning techniques, eleven models in all were developed. Comparative analysis of these produced models suggests that the model based on the random forest technique performs better. The accuracy of the Random Forest model is 96.27%, while the AUC value was found to be 99.21%.

All of these novel compounds were evaluated in vitro against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (LAV isolate). 2'-threo-FddC (29) was the most active of the newly synthesized substances against HIV with an ID50 of 0.8 microgram/mL; ddC had an ID50 of 0.007 micrograms/mL. Because of its potency in the initial tests, 29 was further evaluated in both T cells and macrophage/monocyte cell lines, with several different isolates of HIV. Although 2'-threo-FddC (29) exhibited good antiviral activity in these systems it was less active than AZT in these assays. At 1 microM the inhibition of CFU-GM by 29 was found to be 35-40%; this is slightly higher than seen with AZT.","J Med Chem","Journal of medicinal chemistry","33","8","2150-7","2025-11-04 11:47:57","2025-11-04 11:47:57"

Blood flow in the pancreas is altered by a large number of endogenous and exogenous factors in the context of acute and chronic pancreatitis. The frequency of progression from acute pancreatitis to a chronic form is a controversial question. In acute pancreatitis reductions in blood flow and alterations of microvascular integrity resulting in impaired tissue oxygenation play an important part in the progression and possibly the initiation of the disease. Endothelin and nitric oxide are believed to be two of the most effective vasoactive mediators. The beneficial effect of therapeutic strategies affecting vasoactive mediators is confirmed in experimental studies. Chronic disease is associated with decreased pancreatic blood flow and histological changes in the vasculature in both patients and animal models. Further studies are needed to clarify whether ischemia in chronic pancreatitis is more important in perpetuating the disease or as primary cause of the inflammatory processes.","Zentralbl Chir","Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie","126","11","873-8","2025-11-04 11:47:58","2025-11-04 11:47:58"

Androgenesis is thought to be mediated through abscisic acid (ABA) but other phytohormones, such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, have also been implicated. In view of improving induction protocols, the hormone content of pea, chickpea, and lentil anthers was measured after exposure to cold, centrifugation, electroporation, sonication, osmotic shock, or various combinations thereof using an analytical mass spectrometer. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had a key function during the induction process. In pea, high concentrations of IAA-asparagine (IAA-Asp), a putative IAA metabolite, accumulated during the application of the different stresses. In chickpea, the IAA-Asp concentration increased 30-fold compared to pea but only during the osmotic shock treatment and likely as a result of the presence of exogenous IAA in the medium. In contrast, no treatment in lentil (Lens culinaris) invoked such an increase in IAA-Asp content. Of the various cytokinins monitored, only cis zeatin riboside increased after centrifugation and electroporation in pea and possibly chickpea. No bioactive gibberellins were detected in any species investigated, indicating that this hormone group is likely not linked to androgenesis in legumes. In contrast to the other stresses, osmotic shock treatment caused a reduction in the levels of all hormones analyzed, with the exception of IAA-Asp in chickpea. A short period of low hormone content might be a necessary transition phase for androgenesis induction of legumes.","Plant Cell Rep","Plant cell reports","31","7","1255-67","2025-11-04 11:47:59","2025-11-04 11:47:59"

In this study, male SD rats were treated with water extract(2.5 g·kg~(-1)) and dexamethasone acetate(6.25×10~(-4) g·kg~(-1)) for one week, and the inflammation model was induced by lipopolysaccharide(LPS). Then the counts of inflammatory cells white blood ceel(WBC), eosinophil(EO), lymphocyte(LY), basophils(BA) and neutrophils(NE) in whole blood of rats were observed. The levels of serum inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), IL-6 and the expression of nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB) signaling pathway p65 and p-IκBα proteins in lung tissues were detected, and the change rules of serum endogenous metabolites were analyzed by ~1H-NMR metabonomics technique. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NF-κB signaling pathway p65 and p-IκBα proteins were combined with ~1H-NMR metabonomics to study the anti-inflammatory mechanism of C. crocea. The results showed that the water extract of C. crocea significantly decreased the number of WBC, NE, EO, increased the number of BA and LY, decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and the expression of p65 and p-IκBα protein in NF-κB signaling pathway, and effectively alleviated the inflammatory symptoms. In the correlation analysis of differential metabolites regulated of C. crocea, four significant metabolites were obtained, including glycine, creatine, methionine and succinic acid. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of C. crocea may be related to the decrease of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 levels and the protein expression of NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as the regulation of glycine, creatine, methionine and succinic acid metabolism.","Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi","Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica","45","4","946-954","2025-11-04 11:48:00","2025-11-04 11:48:00"

Subjects performed vertical wall slides and diagonal wall slides (45 degrees angle) with their hand in contact with the wall (supported) and not in contact with the wall (unsupported). Significantly greater supraspinatus activity was found in the unsupported exercises versus the supported exercises (F(4,76) = 4.38, P = .003). Exercises performed in the 45 degrees diagonal position were more demanding on shoulder musculature than vertical exercises (F(1,19) = 19.3, P < .001).

Type II results from a combined deficiency of XDH/XO and aldehyde oxidase. Patients present with hematuria, renal colic, urolithiasis or even acute renal failure. Clinical symptoms are the same for both types. In a third type, clinically distinct, sulfite oxidase activity is missing as well as XDH/XO and aldehyde oxidase. The prevalence is not known, but about 150 cases have been described so far. Hypouricemia is sometimes overlooked, that´s why we have set up the diagnostic flowchart. This consists of a) evaluation of uric acid concentrations in serum and urine with exclusion of primary renal hypouricemia, b) estimation of urinary xanthine, c) allopurinol loading test, which enables to distinguish type I and II; and finally assay of xanthine oxidoreductase activity in plasma with molecular genetic analysis. Following this diagnostic procedure we were able to find first patients with hereditary xanthinuria in our Czech population. We have detected nine cases, which is one of the largest group worldwide. Four patients were asymptomatic. All had profound hypouricemia, which was the first sign and led to referral to our department. Urinary concentrations of xanthine were in the range of 170-598 mmol/mol creatinine (normal < 30 mmol/mol creatinine).

Methodological contributions include a means of estimating relatedness of fraternal co-husbands given multigenerational polyandry, and use of Hamilton's rule and a member-joiner model to specify how inclusive fitness gains of co-husbands may vary according to seniority, opportunity costs, and group size. These methods are applied to various data sets, particularly that of Crook and Crook (1988). The metatheoretical discussion pivots on the critique by evolutionary psychologists of adaptationist accounts of polyandry. Contrary to this critique, I argue that valid adaptationist explanations of such practices do not necessitate cognitive mechanisms evolved specifically to produce polyandry, nor that there must have been exact equivalents of Tibetan agricultural estates and social institutions in human evolutionary history. Specific issues raised when one posits either kin selection or cultural evolution to explain the adaptive features of Tibetan polyandry are also discussed.","Hum Nat","Human nature (Hawthorne, N.Y.)","9","3","225-61","2025-11-04 11:48:17","2025-11-04 11:48:17"

The overflow of dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) from the main trunk of the dog mesenteric artery and its proximal branches during prolonged depolarization (120 min) by K+ (52 mM) was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. 2. K+-induced depolarization resulted in release of both dopamine and NA. The amount of NA released from both blood vessels declined progressively throughout the experiment. In the main trunk the same pattern of release was observed for dopamine, whereas in the proximal branches the overflow of dopamine increased throughout the experiment. 3. The addition of phentolamine (0.2 microM) to the perifusion fluid increased the overflow of both amines. In the presence of sulpiride (1 microM) the overflow of dopamine and NA was found to be increased in the proximal branches, but not in the main trunk. The addition of phentolamine to sulpiride caused a further increase in amine overflow in proximal branches, but not in the main trunk. 4. The addition of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (50 microM) to the perifusion fluid caused a decrease in the amounts of dopamine and NA released from both preparations. In alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated preparations phentolamine increased amine overflow to the same extent as in experiments without tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition. The increasing effect of sulpiride on the overflow of dopamine and NA from the proximal branches was completely abolished after alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. 5. The results presented suggest that in the proximal branches of the dog mesenteric artery, dopamine beta-hydroxylase represents a rate limiting step in the synthesis of NA; dopamine, through activation of prejunctional dopamine receptors acts like a prejunctional co-transmitter in the control of transmitter release, but only newly-synthesized dopamine appears to be responsible for this effect.","Br J Pharmacol","British journal of pharmacology","95","1","218-24","2025-11-04 11:48:17","2025-11-04 11:48:17"

Its deregulation, in part due to inherent mutations, is associated with pathological conditions including congenital deafness. Regulation of Cx26 protein level is critical for its function but the molecular mechanisms involved are partially understood. This study identifies dynamin 2 (Dyn2) as a Cx26 interactor in yeast and mammalian cells. Deletion studies revealed that Cx26-Dyn2 interaction involves the C-terminus of Cx26 and the GTPase effector domain of Dyn2, which is of particular importance for the regulation of the endocytic pathway. Dyn2 inhibition using siRNA or dynasore resulted in reduced Cx26 degradation at the plasma membrane and this was associated with change in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dyn2 regulates Cx26 endocytosis and ubiquitination. These results establish Dyn2 as a Cx26 partner in the regulation of GJIC.","Int J Biochem Cell Biol","The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology","55","N/A","288-97","2025-11-04 11:48:18","2025-11-04 11:48:18"

The main conclusion is that the phototransduction of the cones is the key factor regulating sensitivity. The model consists of a nonlinearity cascaded with three feedback control loops. The nonlinearity is caused by the hydrolysis of cGMP by activated phosphodiesterase. The first feedback loop is divisive, with calcium regulating the photocurrent in the cone outer segment. The second feedback loop is also divisive, with voltage-sensitive channels regulating the membrane voltage of the cone inner segment. The final feedback loop is subtractive, where the membrane voltage of the horizontal cell is subtracted from that of the cone before the cone drives the horizontal and bipolar cells. The model describes adequately the major characteristics of the horizontal cell responses to wide field, spectrally white stimuli. In particular, it shows (1) sensitivity and bandwidth control as a function of background intensity; (2) the major nonlinearities observed in the horizontal cells; and (3) the transition from linear responses toward contrast constancy (Weber's law) for background illuminances ranging from 1-1000 td.","J Vis","Journal of vision","5","4","331-47","2025-11-04 11:48:19","2025-11-04 11:48:19"

At both loci, breaks occurred at multiple, irregularly spaced sites in a approximately 150 nucleotide interval contained within an area of nuclease-hypersensitive chromatin. No consensus sequence could be discerned at or around break sites. Patterns of cleavage observed on individual strands indicated that breaks initially form with a two nucleotide 5' overhang. Broken strands from rad50S mutant cells contained tightly bound protein at their 5' ends.

Many studies have found that more than half of the CHF-related deaths are sudden, and presumably are due to ventricular arrhythmias. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of arrhythmias in the patient with CHF is limited, but left ventricular mechanical abnormalities, diuretic-induced hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and inotropic therapy may play a role. The prevalence of couplets, multiformed ventricular premature complexes or both is very high, averaging 87% in 8 different studies. The prevalence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, determined by ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings, is also quite high; it is approximately 54% in these same studies. Although still unclear, some data now suggest that ventricular arrhythmias may independently influence prognosis in patients with CHF. Future research is obviously necessary to evaluate the influence of antiarrhythmic therapy on survival.

"24997033","Jens F Rehfeld","2014","Gastrointestinal hormones and their targets.","Gastrointestinal hormones are peptides released from endocrine cells and neurons in the digestive tract. More than 30 hormone genes are currently known to be expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, which makes the gut the largest hormone producing organ in the body. Modern biology makes it feasible to conceive the hormones under five headings: The structural homology groups a majority of the hormones into nine families, each of which is assumed to originate from one ancestral gene. The individual hormone gene often has multiple phenotypes due to alternative splicing, tandem organization, or differentiated maturation of the prohormone. By a combination of these mechanisms, more than 100 different hormonally active peptides are released from the gut. Gut hormone genes are also widely expressed in cells outside the gut, some only in extraintestinal endocrine cells and neurons but others also in other cell types. The extraintestinal cells may synthesize different bioactive fragments of the same prohormone due to cell-specific processing pathways. Moreover, endocrine cells, neurons, cancer cells, and, for instance, spermatozoa release the peptides differentially (autocrine, endocrine, neurocrine, paracrine, spermiocrine secretion etc.), so the same peptide may act as a blood-borne hormone, a neurotransmitter, a local growth factor, or a fertility factor. The molecular targets of each bioactive peptide are specific G-protein coupled receptors expressed in the cell membranes of different target cells. Also the target cells of gut hormones occur widespread outside the digestive tract.","Adv Exp Med Biol","Advances in experimental medicine and biology","817","N/A","157-75","2025-11-04 11:48:32","2025-11-04 11:48:32"

Previously, it was demonstrated that low-linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation with 10 Gy of (60)Co gamma rays resulted in an increased incidence of cataracts in male rats compared to female rats. This gender difference was not due to differences in estrogen, since male rats treated with the major secreted estrogen 17-beta-estradiol (E2) showed an identical increase compared to untreated males. We now compare the incidence and rate of progression of cataracts induced by high-LET radiation in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received a single dose of 1 Gy of 600 MeV (56)Fe ions. Lens opacification was measured at 2-4-week intervals with a slit lamp. The incidence and rate of progression of radiation-induced cataracts was significantly increased in the animals in which estrogen was available from endogenous or exogenous sources. Male rats with E2 capsules implanted had significantly higher rates of progression compared to male rats with empty capsules implanted (P = 0.025) but not compared to the intact female rats. These results contrast with data obtained after low-LET irradiation and suggest the possibility that the different types of damage caused by high- and low-LET radiation may be influenced differentially by steroid sex hormones.","Radiat Res","Radiation research","173","2","191-6","2025-11-04 11:48:32","2025-11-04 11:48:32"

The INSIDE (Innovative Solutions for In-beam DosimEtry in Hadrontherapy) in-beam PET scanner, installed at the Italian National Center of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO, Pavia, Italy) synchrotron facility, has already been successfully tested in vivo during a proton therapy treatment. We discuss here the system performance evaluation with carbon ion beams, in view of future in vivo tests. The work is focused on the analysis of activity images obtained with therapeutic treatments delivered to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantoms, as well as on the test of an innovative and robust Monte Carlo simulation technique for the production of reliable prior activity maps. Images are reconstructed using different integration intervals, so as to monitor the activity evolution during and after the treatment. Three procedures to compare activity images are presented, namely Pearson correlation coefficient, Beam's eye view and overall view. Images of repeated irradiations of the same treatments are compared to assess the integration time necessary to provide reproducible images. The range agreement between simulated and experimental images is also evaluated, so as to validate the simulation capability to provide sound prior information. The results indicate that at treatment end, or at most 20 s afterwards, the range measurement is reliable within 1-2 mm, when comparing both different experimental sessions and data with simulations. In conclusion, this work shows that the INSIDE in-beam PET scanner performance is promising towards its in vivo test with carbon ions.","Phys Med Biol","Physics in medicine and biology","63","14","145018","2025-11-04 11:48:35","2025-11-04 11:48:35"

Endoscopy-based diagnosis is essential, since it enables biopsy specimens to be taken. In addition, it can help with locoregional staging of distal tumors. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a key technique for the evaluation and treatment of malignant biliary tumors. Correct staging of cholangiocarcinoma is essential in order to be able to determine the degree of resectability and assess the results of treatment. The tumor is staged based on the TNM classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The approach will depend on the classification of the tumor. Thus, some patients with early-stage disease could benefit from surgery; complete surgical resection is the cornerstone of cure. However, only a minority of patients are diagnosed in the early stages and are suitable candidates for resection. In the subset of patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemotherapy has been used to improve outcome and to delay tumor progression. The approach to biliary tract tumors should be multidisciplinary, involving experienced endoscopists, oncologists, radiologists, and surgeons.","World J Clin Cases","World journal of clinical cases","7","14","1732-1752","2025-11-04 11:48:37","2025-11-04 11:48:37"

Muscarinic receptors are involved in neuronal function in the brain and autonomic nervous system, and much attention has been paid to these receptors as targets of analgesic drugs in the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated the effects of tramadol on type-3 muscarinic (M(3)) receptors using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Tramadol (10 nM-100 micro M) inhibited acetylcholine-induced currents in oocytes expressing M(3) receptor. Although GF109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor, increased the basal current, it had little effect on the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents by tramadol. Moreover, tramadol inhibited the specific binding sites of [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. These findings suggest that tramadol at clinically relevant concentrations inhibits M(3) function via quinuclidinyl benzilate-binding sites. This may explain the modulation of neuronal function and the anticholinergic effects of tramadol.","Anesth Analg","Anesthesia and analgesia","95","5","1269-73, table of contents","2025-11-04 11:48:38","2025-11-04 11:48:38"

We previously reported that gK binds to signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and that depletion of SPP reduces HSV-1 infectivity in vivo. To determine the therapeutic potential of blocking gK binding to SPP on virus infectivity and pathogenicity, we mapped the gK binding site for SPP to a 15mer peptide within the amino-terminus of gK. This 15mer peptide reduced infectivity of three different virus strains in vitro as determined by plaque assay, FACS, and RT-PCR. Similarly, the 15mer peptide reduced ocular virus replication in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and also reduced levels of latency and exhaustion markers in infected mice when compared with control treated mice. Addition of the gK-15mer peptide also increased the survival of infected mice when compared with control mice. These results suggest that blocking gK binding to SPP using gK peptide may have therapeutic potential in treating HSV-1-associated infection.","PLoS Pathog","PLoS pathogens","17","8","e1009848","2025-11-04 11:48:38","2025-11-04 11:48:38"

For solutions with added salt, on the other hand, those dielectric parameters were independent of salt concentration up to a certain critical value and started to decrease with further increasing salt concentration. This critical behavior is well explained by our newly extended cell model that takes into account the spatial distribution of loosely bound counterions around DNA molecules as a function of salt concentration.","Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys","Physical review.

The patient then presents with inability to flex or extend metacarpophalageal or interphalangeal joints. Multiple ruptures resulting in impaired function of several fingers can also occur and markedly limit the hand's grip strength. A tear may arise from either mechanical injury to the tendon along its course over bone or connective tissues, or by biochemical action of lysosomal enzymes, released during the inflammation process, on the connective tissue of the tendon. Ischaemic damage to a part of the tendon due to constriction of vessels supplying the peritenonium is found in hypertrophic peri-tenosynovitis. Spontaneous ruptures can be prevented, in the first place, by early synovectomy and then by a number of prophylactic procedures on soft tissues and carpal bones, which can stop or at least slow down the development of severe axial deformities of the wrist and hand. Simple end-to-end suture of the stumps is usually not possible; tendon repair surgery using free grafts or, more often, intact tendon transfer is necessary. In the flexor part, transfer of the superficial flexor tendon to a stump of the deep flexor tendon is frequently performed; a free graft can also be used at a two-stage tendon reconstruction. The repair of flexor tendons is technically more demanding and the results are less satisfactory compared to repair surgery on the extensor tendon. Key words: rheumatoid arthritis, metacarpophalageal joint, interphalangeal joint, tendon rupture.","Acta Chir Orthop Traumatol Cech","Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca","83","6","375-380","2025-11-04 11:48:41","2025-11-04 11:48:41"

In the current study, we investigated whether children's assumed experience with communication failures would increase their skills when it came to repairing communication failure. Non-German bilingual, German bilingual, and monolingual 2.5-year-old toddlers participated in a communication task in which a misunderstanding occurred. We hypothesized that monolingual and German bilingual children would have fewer daily communication failures-and, therefore, less well-trained repair skills-compared with non-German bilinguals. The results showed that non-German bilinguals were more likely to repair the misunderstanding compared with both monolingual children and German bilingual children.

Phenotyping analyses have revealed an association between NAT enzyme activities and the risk of developing several forms of cancer. As genotyping procedures have become available for NAT1 and NAT2 gene variations, hundreds of association studies on NAT polymorphisms and cancer risk have been conducted. Here we review the findings obtained from these studies. Evidence for a putative association of NAT1 polymorphism and myeloma, lung and bladder cancer, as well as association of NAT2 polymorphisms with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver, colorectal and bladder cancer have been reported. In contrast, no consistent evidence for a relevant association of NAT polymorphisms with brain, head & neck, breast, gastric, pancreatic or prostate cancer have been described. Although preliminary data are available, further well-powered studies are required to fully elucidate the role of NAT1 in most human cancers, and that of NAT2 in astrocytoma, meningioma, esophageal, renal, cervical and testicular cancers, as well as in leukaemia and myeloma. This review discusses controversial findings on cancer risk and putative causes of heterogeneity in the proposed associations, and it identifies topics that require further investigation, particularly mechanisms underlying association of NAT polymorphisms and risk for subsets of cancer patients with specific exposures, putative epistatic contribution of polymorphism for other xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases of Cytochrome P450 enzymes, and genetic plus environmental interaction.","Curr Drug Metab","Current drug metabolism","9","6","520-31","2025-11-04 11:48:54","2025-11-04 11:48:54"

Promastigotes of Leishmania are internalized by macrophages and transformed into amastigotes in phagosomes, and replicate in phagolysosomes. Phagosomal maturation arrest is known to play a crucial role in the survival of pathogenic Leishmania within activated macrophages. Recently, tryptophan-aspartate containing coat (TACO) gene has been recognized as playing a central role in the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within human macrophages by arresting the phagosome maturation process. We postulated that a similar association of TACO gene with phagosomes would prevent the vacuole from maturation in the case of Leishmania. In this study we attempted to define the effect of TACO gene downregulation on the entry/survival of Leishmania donovani intracellularly, by treatment with Vitamin D3 (Vit.D3)/Retinoic acid (RA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)/RA combinations in human THP-1 macrophages (in vitro). Treatment with these molecules downregulated the TACO gene in macrophages, resulting in reduced parasite load and marked reduction of disease progression in L. donovani infected macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that TACO gene downregulation may play a role in subverting macrophage machinery in establishing the L. donovani replicative niche inside the host. Our study is the first to highlight the important role of the TACO gene in Leishmania entry, survival and to identify TACO gene downregulation as potential drug target against leishmaniasis.","Front Microbiol","Frontiers in microbiology","6","N/A","946","2025-11-04 11:48:56","2025-11-04 11:48:56"

However, such studies have thus far relied on food images and computerised tasks, limiting real-world implications. The present study tested 32 healthy male participants (16 being overweight) for attentional biases in an ad libitum buffet setting, using wearable eye-trackers. The eye-tracking analyses suggested that sugar content moderated visual fixation biases (p < 0.05), whereas BMI exerted significant effects on pupil diameter (p < 0.05). In addition, findings from the study revealed tripartite relationships between eye-tracking, self-reported liking, and ad libitum intake. Although visual fixation in the ""view"" condition was correlated with liking for high-calorie food, further analyses showed that this measure was not a strong predictor of food selection. Instead, visual fixation during the selection task could be the key predictor for selection of savoury food. In contrast, neither eye-tracking nor self-reported measures could adequately predict selection of desserts, implicating distinct decision-making processes for different types of food. Due to the small sample size, findings from this study should be replicated in future research. Overall, this study highlights the importance of realistic experimental settings in eye-tracking studies for understanding eating behaviour.","Appetite","Appetite","125","N/A","152-159","2025-11-04 11:49:01","2025-11-04 11:49:01"

Pregnant Wistar rats were treated subcutaneously with either corn oil or BP at doses of 10, 100, or 200 mg/kg, from gestational day (GD) 12 until GD 20 for female foetal gonad evaluation, and from GD 12 until the end of lactation to evaluate sexual parameters on the female offspring. Immature female rats were also used in the uterotrophic assay to evaluate the possible estrogenic action of parabens. Our results revealed that, in this experimental protocol, BP did not show estrogenic activity at the doses used and did not impair sexual development and fertility capacity in the female rats, but impaired sexual behavior. We conclude that brain sexual development may be more sensitive to BP effects and we speculate that doses higher than 100 mg/kg (the male lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for rodent reproductive parameters) would be necessary to promote damages in the female reproduction, regarding the same protocol of exposure. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We found an MYB transcription factor (PtrMYB119) from Populus trichocarpa that positively regulates anthocyanin production when expressed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that PtrMYB119 is highly homologous to Arabidopsis PAP1 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1), a well-known transcriptional activator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Independently produced transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrMYB119 or PtrMYB120 (a paralogous gene to PtrMYB119) (i.e., 35S::PtrMYB119 and 35S::PtrMYB120, respectively) showed elevated accumulation of anthocyanins in the whole plants, including leaf, stem and even root tissues. Using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, we confirmed that the majority of the accumulated anthocyanin in our transgenic poplar is cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. Gene expression analyses revealed that most of the genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway were highly upregulated in 35S::PtrMYB119 poplars compared with the nontransformed control poplar. Among these genes, expression of PtrCHS1 (Chalcone Synthase1) and PtrANS2 (Anthocyanin Synthase2), which catalyze the initial and last steps of anthocyanin biosynthesis, respectively, was upregulated by up to 350-fold. Subsequent transient activation assays confirmed that PtrMYB119 activated the transcription of both PtrCHS1 and PtrANS2 Interestingly, expression of MYB182, a repressor of both anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis, was largely suppressed in 35S::PtrMYB119 poplars, while expression of MYB134, an activator of PA biosynthesis, was not changed significantly. More interestingly, high-level accumulation of anthocyanins in 35S::PtrMYB119 poplars did not have an adverse effect on plant growth. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PtrMYB119 and PtrMYB120 function as transcriptional activators of anthocyanin accumulation in both Arabidopsis and poplar.","Tree Physiol","Tree physiology","36","9","1162-76","2025-11-04 11:49:07","2025-11-04 11:49:07"

The purpose of this study was to (a) describe the neuropsychological characteristics of a pilot sample of Hispanic children with CblC disease and (b) explore potential differences in outcome based on underlying genetic mutation(s) and biochemical levels. Six Hispanic children (ages 2-10) diagnosed with CblC disease through newborn screening (NBS) underwent neuropsychological evaluation with a bilingual examiner. Biochemical levels and underlying mutation(s) were obtained through medical records. The overall sample performed below normative expectations across neuropsychological domains, including general cognition, adaptive functioning, language ability, and visual-motor integration. Underlying mutations and associative clinical phenotypes were found to significantly predict general cognitive abilities, while plasma methionine and Hcy at the time of diagnosis were significantly correlated with language outcomes. Despite limited sample size, results indicate that Hispanic children with CblC disease detected through NBS and treated early experience neuropsychological deficits even when treated with current standard treatments. However, consistent with prior research in non-Hispanic children with CblC disease, underlying mutations and early biochemical levels may predict better outcomes in this population as well.","Appl Neuropsychol Child","Applied neuropsychology.

We set out to review the clinical features of ten cases of PAO from a single UK centre. Patients had attended the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Bath (RNHRD) between January 2000 and June 2016. The principal criterion for inclusion was the occurrence of low trauma fractures either during pregnancy or the immediate post-partum period. Data were obtained from retrospective review of medical notes. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic ®Discovery system) at the lumbar spine and hip. Data pertaining to the pregnancy, as well as type and duration of treatment received, were reviewed. All ten cases presented with vertebral fractures. In four patients, no risk factors for fracture other than pregnancy or breastfeeding could be identified. Four patients were found to have vitamin D insufficiency at the time of diagnosis, and a further two patients had received treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). In one case, further investigation led to a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) confirmed on genetic testing. In terms of treatment, eight out of the ten patients in this series received a bisphosphonate, most commonly risedronate due to its relatively short skeletal retention time. Clinicians should be aware of PAO, a rare but recognised complication of pregnancy. The condition should be especially considered in women presenting with new onset back pain in pregnancy or the postpartum period.","Osteoporos Int","Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA","30","5","939-948","2025-11-04 11:49:11","2025-11-04 11:49:11"

The response to the trailing image is weaker if it follows the leading image with which it was paired during training than if it follows some other leading image. Prediction suppression is a plausible neural mechanism for statistical learning of visual transitions such as has been demonstrated in behavioral studies of human infants and adults. However, in the human studies, subjects are exposed to continuous sequences in which the same image can be both predicted and predicting and statistical dependency can exist between nonadjacent items. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether prediction suppression in ITC develops under such circumstances. To resolve this issue, we exposed monkeys repeatedly to triplets of images presented in fixed order.

Verapamil and diltiazem (0.01 to 5 mM) inhibited both (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity and initial rates of 45Ca2+ net uptake analogously. In general, the parameter affected most by these drugs, using either Ca2+ transport or (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-5'-adenosine-triphospho-hydrolase (EC 3.6.1.3) ([Ca2+ + Mg2+]-ATPase) measurements, was the stimulation by calmodulin. However, the specificity and selectivity of inhibition appeared to be highly concentration and membrane preparation dependent. Verapamil and diltiazem inhibited the calmodulin-Ca2+ transport concentration-effect relationship by changing its apparent affinity as well as the maximal velocity of the process. In a ""white ghost"" membrane preparation, bepridil inhibited calmodulin activation with a high degree of selectivity as opposed to its effects on calmodulin activation in the vesicular preparation. Nifedipine failed to exhibit any specificity and modestly inhibited basal and calmodulin-activated inside-out vesicular Ca2+ transport and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase alike. Our results suggest that verapamil, diltiazem and bepridil (0.01 to 0.3 mM), but not nifedipine (1 nM to 0.01 mM), in relatively high concentrations can antagonize the calmodulin-stimulated Ca2(+)-pump, i.e. the ATPase as well as the transport process.

Identification of transformation by-products of DCF by HPLC-UV-MS(n) gave evidence of decarboxylation, iminoquinone formation and dimerization. The fast oxidation of DCF is also accompanied by a strong adsorption of organic carbon that was explained by the sorption of dimer products on the surface of manganese oxide. Decarboxylation and dimerization increased the hydrophobic interactions with manganese oxide and reduced the presence of potentially toxic by-products in the effluent. The rate of oxidation was first order with respect to DCF and was slowed down by the presence of organic buffer MOPS (3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid). The first order rate constant in absence of MOPS was extrapolated by considering a surface site-binding model and MOPS as a co-adsorbate. The rate constant was 0.818 min(-1) at pH 7 and 10 mM NaCl corresponding to empty bed residence time of 50 s only for 50% removal of DCF. Rate constants increased when pH decreased from pH 8.0 to 6.5 and when ionic strength increased.

Trophic shifts demand a high degree of behavioral flexibility to account for different physical circumstances between water and air to keep performance in both environments. The Himalayan newt, Tylototriton verrucosus, is mostly terrestrial but becomes aquatic during its short breeding period. Nonetheless, it was assumed that it lacks the capability of trophic behavioral flexibility, only captures prey on land by its tongue (lingual prehension) and does not feed in water. This theory was challenged from stomach content analyses in wild populations that found a variety of aquatic invertebrates in the newts' stomachs during their breeding season. Accordingly, we hypothesized that T. verrucosus actively changes its terrestrial prey capture mechanism to hunt for aquatic prey at least during its aquatic stage. In fact, the kinematic analyses showed that T. verrucosus uses lingual prehension to capture prey on land but changes to suction feeding for aquatic strikes. The statistical analyses revealed that terrestrial and aquatic strikes differ significantly in most kinematic parameters while behavioral variability does not differ between both behaviors. In turn, the movement patterns in suction feeding showed a higher degree of coordination between jaw and hyoid movements compared to the putative primary feeding mode, namely lingual prehension. We conclude that T. verrucosus, though relatively slow compared to trophic specialists, benefits from a high degree of behavioral flexibility that allows exploiting food sources efficiently from two very different habitats.","Biol Open","Biology open","5","10","1500-1507","2025-11-04 11:49:19","2025-11-04 11:49:19"

At least 25% of the I beta IR population stains positively for all three peptides. A substantial number of cells stained with markers for two, or all three, peptide families, could be retrogradely labeled following tracer deposits centered in the PVH.

The drugs were given intravenously and orally making it possible to estimate the absolute bioavailability. The bioavailability of propylthiouracil (about 80%) was unchanged by the surgical procedure but the fraction of ampicillin (given as pivampicillin) absorbed decreased from a preoperative value of 109 +/- 44% to 44 +/- 30% 12 months after the bypass operation. Volumes of distribution transiently decreased in the postoperative period for ampicillin. Clearance was initially reduced for both ampicillin and propylthiouracil after operation but returned to normal values a year later. Half-lives of both drugs were unchanged. These results are compared with previous data on pharmacokinetics in intestinal shunt patients and a tabular review is presented. Although no general rules presently emerge from the data available, it seems prudent to closely monitor intestinal shunt patients on drug therapy by both laboratory and clinical methods.","Clin Pharmacokinet","Clinical pharmacokinetics","9","2","168-76","2025-11-04 11:49:22","2025-11-04 11:49:22"

In two correlational studies, it was found that habit interacted with intention when context stability was taken into account and not when merely past behaviour frequency was considered: intentions guided future behaviour when habits were weak (low frequency or unstable context), while this was not the case when habits were strong (high frequency and stable context). A third exploratory study investigated and confirmed the idea that, if habitual goal-directed behaviour is directly activated by the context, mental accessibility of the behaviour (i.e. the ease of accessing the goal-directed behaviour in memory) moderates the intention-behaviour relation in a similar way. These findings are discussed against the background of current research on goal-directed habits and the cognitive processes underlying them.","Br J Soc Psychol","The British journal of social psychology","47","Pt 2","245-65","2025-11-04 11:49:22","2025-11-04 11:49:22"

An in vitro assay demonstrated the presence, in serum, of an inhibitor of binding to the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor that suggested the possibility of a similar autoimmune process underlying the myasthenia gravis and premature ovarian failure.

There is considerable interest in probiotics for a variety of medical conditions, and millions of people around the world consume probiotics daily for perceived health benefits. Lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and lactococci have generally been regarded as safe. There are 3 theoretical concerns regarding the safety of probiotics: (1) the occurrence of disease, such as bacteremia or endocarditis; (2) toxic or metabolic effects on the gastrointestinal tract; and (3) the transfer of antibiotic resistance in the gastrointestinal flora. In this review, the evidence for safety of the use of or the study of probiotics is examined. Although there are rare cases of bacteremia or fungemia related to the use of probiotics, epidemiologic evidence suggests no population increase in risk on the basis of usage data. There have been many controlled clinical trials on the use of probiotics that demonstrate safe use. The use of probiotics in clinical trials should be accompanied by the use of a data-safety monitoring board and by knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the organism used.","Clin Infect Dis","Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","46 Suppl 2","N/A","S104-11; discussion S144-51","2025-11-04 11:49:26","2025-11-04 11:49:26"

This provided a uniform chemical gradient to which initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were immobilized. After surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) chains were grafted from the surface and the measured thickness profiles provided direct evidence for how surface crowding provides an entropic driving force resulting in chain extension away from the surface. Film thicknesses were found to increase with the position along the gradient surface, reflecting the gradual transition from collapsed to more extended surface-tethered polymer chains as the grafting density increased. The method described is novel in that the approach provides covalent linkages from the polymer coating to the substrate and is not limited to a particular surface chemistry of the starting material.","Langmuir","Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","30","28","8357-65","2025-11-04 11:49:28","2025-11-04 11:49:28"

MVA-5T4 (TroVax(®)) is a novel vaccine combining the tumor-associated antigen 5T4 to an engineered vector-modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). MVA helps to express the oncofetal 5T4 antigen and subsequently trigger a tumor-directed immune reaction. The safety and clinical benefit reported in multiple phase I and II clinical trials using MVA-5T4 were encouraging; immune responses were induced in almost all treated patients, and associations between 5T4-specific cellular or humoral responses and clinical benefit were reported in most of the nine phase II trials. In particular, clinical studies conducted in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients have demonstrated an association between 5T4-specific (but not MVA) antibody responses and enhanced survival. This review describes the clinical studies using MVA-5T4 conducted in RCC that convincingly demonstrated that an antigen-specific immune response induced by vaccination is associated with enhanced patient survival and is not simply a function of the general ""health"" of patients. We will also provide our expert opinions on possible future better-designed clinical trials based on relevant biomarkers.

Conflicting data exist, however, on the influence of LV loading conditions on these measurements. Therefore, simultaneous LV micromanometer pressure measurements, 2-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler studies were performed before and after preload or afterload manipulation in 16 patients with coronary artery disease. Nitroprusside (n = 9) was administered in combination with saline to maintain preload and achieve a 10 to 20% reduction in mean aortic pressure. Saline (n = 7) was administered (850 +/- 240 ml) to increase LV end-diastolic pressure 25 to 50%. All measurements were obtained during atrial pacing at a heart rate 10 to 15 beats/min above resting sinus rate. The administration of nitroprusside plus saline decreased LV end-systolic wall stress (94 +/- 27 to 67 +/- 14 g/cm2 X 10(3), p = 0.011) without changing LV end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic dimension. Peak velocity (0.8 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3, p = 0.044), velocity time integral (11 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 5 cm, p = 0.049) and mean acceleration (12 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 7 m/s2, p = 0.0014) increased significantly. The administration of saline alone significantly increased LV end-diastolic pressure (10 +/- 4 to 22 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.0006), LV end-diastolic dimension (4.8 +/- 0.5 to 5.1 +/- 0.5 cm, p = 0.0001), peak velocity (0.9 +/- 0.3 to 1.0 +/- 0.4 m/s, p = 0.008), velocity-time integral (14 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 7 cm, p = 0.005), and mean acceleration (14 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 7 m/s2, p = 0.041).

Intravesical oxybutynin was well tolerated, efficacious and rapidly absorbed, resulting in plasma concentrations markedly higher than after oral administration. In only 2 patients did this method of instillation result in side effects, and both had previously undergone bladder augmentation. This lack of significant systemic side effects despite high plasma concentrations suggests that a metabolite may be generated after oral administration that is responsible for the side effects.

A cross-modal comparison of associative memory stimuli.","To test the claim that odors are the 'best' cues to memory, several cross-modal experiments were conducted in which odors were compared with verbal, visual, tactile and musical stimuli as associated memory cues. Each experiment comprised two sessions (encoding and retrieval) separated by 48 hr. At the encoding session, a series of stimuli were incidentally associated to a set of emotionally arousing pictures. At the retrieval session, memory accuracy and emotionality were assessed. Across experiments, results revealed that odors were equivalent to other stimuli in their ability to elicit accurate recall, but that odor-evoked memories were always more emotional. Notably, emotional responses did not vary as a function of stimulus type at encoding. These data indicate that emotional saliency, rather than accuracy, is responsible for the impression that odors are superior reminders, and that retrieval processes (cf. encoding processes) are responsible for the distinctive emotionality of odor-evoked memories.","Ann N Y Acad Sci","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","855","N/A","670-4","2025-11-04 11:49:44","2025-11-04 11:49:44"

The appearance of wheezing on pulmonary auscultation was used to determine PCW (provocative concentration of methacholine causing wheezing). For all tests, methacholine diluted in saline at increasing concentrations (0.025, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/ml) was delivered with O2 (5 ml/min) via a face mask.

No collateral effects were observed, except for tachypnea and tachycardia. There was a statistically significant difference between the PCW for WB (2.3 mg/ml) and the PCW for C (9.2 mg/ml). A 5 mg/ml concentration of methacholine provides the clearest distinction between the WB and C groups. Indeed, we observed that 96% of WB and 25% of C demonstrated PCW below this concentration. In the WB group, those with mild symptoms had higher PCW values. When the BPT was repeated in 27 WB at an 8-month interval, statistically significant differences between the two PCV values were observed. The highest PCW values were evidenced in the second BPT.

At pH less than 5 all backbone NH signals can be observed, and NOESY experiments provided a large set of dipolar cross-peaks. Cross-peak intensities from each experiment (different mixing times and H2O versus D2O) were converted to distance constraints using a novel algorithm (program DISCON) for removing spin diffusion effects and thus obtain cross-rates rather than cross-peak intensities. A set of 168 nonstereospecific distance bounds (average experimental precision, +/- 0.38 A) was used in dynamics simulated annealing refinements. Two consensus structural features were found--a reverse turn at Ser5----Asp8 and an alpha-helical stretch from Lys9 to Cys15; however, after constraint-free minimization, structures generated using XPLOR-1.5, CONGEN, and DISCOVER all violated at least 32% of the bounds by more than 0.2 A, which we ascribe to conformational isomerism. When the constraints were modified to reflect subsequent experimental data and to eliminate constraints that could not be obeyed by any single conformer structure, the relaxed structures still violated at least 15% of this more limited and looser set of constraints. Therefore, a modified procedure for constrained dynamics refinement (using XPLOR-2.1), which allows for conformational isomerism outside of the central helical core region, was developed. This ""conformer search procedure"" produced structures which fell into five tightly defined conformational clusters. The two most populated clusters correspond to a rotation of the 8,9-amide unit. The conformer which we propose as the major contributor at pH 3.2-5.8 was defined to a backbone rmsd of 0.51 A over residues 1----15. An alternative description of the motional averaging in segments of the endothelin structure as extensive randomization rather than rapid interconversion between a small number of discreet conformers was ruled out by an analysis of NH shift-temperature gradients and exchange rates. This analysis suggests that small delta delta/delta T values need not correlate with H-bonding for conformational mixtures. In ET-1 the greatest motional averaging occurs from Ser2 through Ser5 (not in the C-terminus) and may be so extensive as to approximate a flexible random coil population as high as 30%. The C-terminus shows less rapid and less extensive conformational averaging, but no definitive structures for individual conformers could be derived in the absence of stereospecific constraints. The pharmacological implications of the consensus structural features are discussed.","Biochemistry","Biochemistry","31","5","1280-95","2025-11-04 11:49:47","2025-11-04 11:49:47"

Previously, reduced ASB activity was reported in cystic fibrosis patients and in malignant human mammary epithelial cell lines in tissue culture compared to normal cells. ASB silencing and overexpression were associated with alterations in syndecan-1 and decorin expression in MCF-7 cells and in IL-8 secretion in human bronchial epithelial cells. In this report, we present the role of ASB in the regulation of the kininogen-bradykinin axis owing to its effect on chondroitin-4-sulfation and the interaction of C4S with kininogen. Silencing or overexpression of ASB in normal rat kidney epithelial cells in tissue culture modified the content of total sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), C4S, kininogen, and bradykinin in spent media and cell lysates. Treatment of the cultured cells with chondroitinase ABC also increased the secretion of bradykinin into the spent media and reduced the C4S-associated kininogen. When ASB was overexpressed, the cellular kininogen that associated with C4S declined, suggesting a vital role for chondroitin-4-sulfation in regulating the kininogen-C4S interaction. These findings suggest that ASB, owing to its effect on chondroitin-4-sulfation, may impact on the kininogen-bradykinin axis and, thereby, may influence blood pressure. Because ASB activity is influenced by several ions, including chloride and phosphate, ASB activity may provide a link between salt responsiveness and the bradykinin-associated mechanism of blood pressure regulation.","Biochim Biophys Acta","Biochimica et biophysica acta","1802","5","472-7","2025-11-04 11:49:50","2025-11-04 11:49:50"

The Synergetic Roadmap 2022 report is the first annual update, featuring 20 indicators across five aspects: synergetic governance system and practices, progress in structural transition, air pollution and associated weather-climate interactions, sources, sinks, and mitigation pathway of atmospheric composition, and health impacts and benefits of coordinated control.

These milestones include the proportion of non-fossil power generation capacity surpassing coal-fired capacity for the first time, a decline in the production of crude steel and cement after years of growth, and the surging penetration of electric vehicles. Additionally, in 2022, China issued the first national policy that synergizes abatements of pollution and carbon emissions, marking a new era for China's pollution-carbon co-control.

The physiological mechanism(s) of gelatinase activation are still poorly understood; their comprehension may provide tools to control cell invasion. The data reported in this paper show multiple roles of the uPA-plasmin system in the control of gelatinase activity: (i) both gelatinases are associated with the cell surface; binding of uPA and plasmin(ogen) to the cell surface results in gelatinase activation without the action of other metallo- or acid proteinases; (ii) inhibition of uPA or plasminogen binding to the cell surface blocks gelatinase activation; (iii) in soluble phase plasmin degrades both gelatinases; and (iv) gelatinase activation and degradation occur in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the presence of physiological plasminogen and uPA concentrations.

Why this occurs is unknown but is not believed to reflect myocardial ischemia. Exercise thallium testing is often used for noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with conditions known to result in false-positive electrocardiographic responses. To assess the effects of ventricular preexcitation on exercise thallium testing, 8 men (aged 42 +/- 4 years) with this finding were studied. No subject had signs or symptoms of coronary artery disease. Subjects exercised on a bicycle ergometer to a double product of 26,000 +/- 2,000 (+/- standard error of mean). All but one of the subjects had at least 1 mm of ST-segment depression. Tests were terminated because of fatigue or dyspnea and no patient had chest pain. Thallium test results were abnormal in 5 patients, 2 of whom had stress defects as well as abnormally delayed thallium washout. One of these subjects had normal coronary arteries on angiography with a negative ergonovine challenge, and both had normal exercise radionuclide ventriculographic studies. Delayed thallium washout was noted in 3 of the subjects with ventricular preexcitation and normal stress images. This study suggests that exercise thallium testing is frequently abnormal in subjects with ventricular preexcitation. Ventricular preexcitation may cause dyssynergy of ventricular activation, which could alter myocardial thallium handling, much as occurs with left bundle branch block.

The MRA algorithm is used to construct a mel-scaled wavelet packet filter-bank, from which subband powers are computed as the feature parameters for speech recognition. Wiener filtering is applied to a few selected subbands at some intermediate stages of decomposition. For high-frequency bands, Wiener filters are designed based on a reduced fraction of the estimated noise power, making the consonant features much more prominent and contrastive. The proposed method is evaluated in phone recognition experiments with the TIMIT database. In the presence of stationary white noise at 10-dB SNR, the de-noised MRA features attain a phone recognition rate of 32%. There is a noticeable improvement compared with the accuracy of 29% and 20% attained by the commonly used mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) with and without cepstral mean normalization (CMN), respectively. The effectiveness of the MRA features is also verified by the fact that they exhibit smaller distortion from clean speech.","J Acoust Soc Am","The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","110","5 Pt 1","2567-74","2025-11-04 11:49:57","2025-11-04 11:49:57"

Despite country-specific evidence about the effects of TFA on cardiovascular disease in Costa Rica, policy regulation has yet to occur. This qualitative study uses a conceptual framework to identify factors that may impede or promote the process of translation of scientific evidence about TFA into policy in the specific context of Costa Rica. We used single case-study methodology to integrate two sources of data: review of relevant internal documents and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 respondents purposively sampled from three sectors: the cooking oil and food industries, research and academia, and government entities. Content analysis, guided by a conceptual framework of research utilization, revealed 68 emergent themes divided across four categories of analysis. In brief, study participants perceived the political context suitable for discussing policies related to healthy fats. Nevertheless, TFA regulation was not part of the Costa Rican political agenda. Barriers perceived by respondents that impede knowledge translation included: (1) lack of awareness of in-country scientific studies on health effects of TFA; (2) lack of consensus or information about policy options (nutrition labelling, dietary guidelines, legislative mandates); (3) perceived distrust and disparate attitudes between sectors, believed by study participants to result in (4) limited collaboration across sectors. Commissioned task forces and other mechanisms to foster research engagement and facilitate sustained interaction and systematic collaboration among government, food industry and researcher sectors appear crucial in the consideration and adoption of nutrition policy in Costa Rica and other emerging economies.","Health Policy Plan","Health policy and planning","22","6","363-74","2025-11-04 11:49:59","2025-11-04 11:49:59"

Crosslinked stable products were then observed by electronmicroscopy after non-crosslinked portions were briefly digested by trypsin to unfold chromosomes.--When the DNA-histone crosslink was the primary product, trypsin readily unfolded the whole chromosome structure while preserving the 250 A unit chromatin fiber intact; only a single unit fiber was tracked within the centromere region connecting the arms of each chromatid. When a histone polymer was formed by a prolonged formaldehyde crosslinking, trypsin digestion gave rise to chromatin fibers interacting with others at certain distances, and the typical chromosome structure remained unchanged. Regardless of the degree of crosslinking, there were neither thick supercoiled unit fibers nor proteinaceous cores.--These results suggest that the fiber connection may represent, to some extent, the interacting sites of folded chromatin fibers in situ within chromosomes, and also that the 250 A unit fibers are the sole, highest structural basis in chromosomes. Since virtually no appreciable histone digestion took place in the crosslinked chromosomes, the observation that even after DNA-histone crosslinking the fiber interacting sites were accessible to trypsin preferentially over other portions, may be consistent with our recent results that the exposed, lysine-rich tails of histones represent such interacting sites.","Chromosoma","Chromosoma","78","1","123-35","2025-11-04 11:49:59","2025-11-04 11:49:59"

Substitution of domain IV was the most important determinant of activation time constant and time constant for recovery from inactivation, with domains I and II mediating a smaller role. In contrast, the carboxy terminal region did not appear to be involved. Determinants of the time constant for inactivation could not be localized to a specific transmembrane domain, but the concomitant substitution of domains I+IV was able to partially confer the inactivation kinetics among the two wild type channels.

However, seagrass habitats are declining worldwide, threatened by global climate change and regional shifts in water quality. Acoustical methods have been applied to assess changes in oxygen production of seagrass meadows since sound propagation is sensitive to the presence of bubbles, which exist both within the plant tissue and freely floating the water as byproducts of photosynthesis. This work applies acoustic remote sensing techniques to characterize two different regions of a seagrass meadow: a densely vegetated meadow of Thalassia testudinum and a sandy region sparsely populated by isolated stands of T. testudinum. A Bayesian approach is applied to estimate the posterior probability distributions of the unknown model parameters. The sensitivity of sound to the void fraction of gas present in the seagrass meadow was established by the narrow marginal probability distributions that provided distinct estimates of the void fraction between the two sites. The absolute values of the estimated void fractions are biased by limitations in the forward model, which does not capture the full complexity of the seagrass environment. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the potential use of acoustical methods to remotely sense seagrass health and density.","J Acoust Soc Am","The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","147","3","2002","2025-11-04 11:50:03","2025-11-04 11:50:03"

Differential screening of cDNA libraries representing banana pulp at ripening stages 1 and 3 has led to the isolation of 11 nonredundant groups of differentially expressed mRNAs. Identification of these transcripts by partial sequence analysis indicates that two of the mRNAs encode proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, whereas others encode proteins thought to be associated with pathogenesis, senescence, or stress responses in plants. Their relative abundance in the pulp and tissue-specific distribution in greenhouse-grown banana plants were determined by northern-blot analyses. The relative abundance of transcripts encoding starch synthase, granule-bound starch synthase, chitinase, lectin, and a type-2 metallothionein decreased in pulp during ripening. Transcripts encoding endochitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, a thaumatin-like protein, ascorbate peroxidase, metallothionein, and a putative senescence-related protein increased early in ripening. The elucidation of the molecular events associated with banana ripening will facilitate a better understanding and control of these processes, and will allow us to attain our long-term goal of producing candidate oral vaccines in transgenic banana plants.","Plant Physiol","Plant physiology","115","2","463-9","2025-11-04 11:50:05","2025-11-04 11:50:05"

Sugars are used primarily for the metabolic production of ATP energy and carbon sources. Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide that is present in many organisms. In insects, the principal hemolymph sugar is trehalose instead of glucose. As in mammals, hemolymph sugar levels in Drosophila are regulated by the action of endocrine hormones. Therefore, the mobilization of trehalose to glucose is thought to be critical for metabolic homeostasis. However, the physiological role of trehalose as a hemolymph sugar during insect development remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that mutants of the trehalose-synthesizing enzyme Tps1 failed to produce trehalose as expected but survived into the late pupal period and died before eclosion. Larvae without trehalose grew normally, with a slight reduction in body size, under normal food conditions. However, these larvae were extremely sensitive to starvation, possibly due to a local defect in the central nervous system. Furthermore, Tps1 mutant larvae failed to grow on a low-sugar diet and exhibited severe growth defects on a low-protein diet. These diet-dependent phenotypes of Tps1 mutants demonstrate the critical role of trehalose during development in Drosophila and reveal how animals adapt to changes in nutrient availability.","J Biol Chem","The Journal of biological chemistry","290","2","1244-55","2025-11-04 11:50:07","2025-11-04 11:50:07"

The study was conducted between July 2019 and January 2020 at the Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, University Hospital Rijeka, with 143 cancer patients, using the linguistically validated Croatian version of the measure. All patients found the measure acceptable. Confirmatory factor analysis aligned with the structure found in previous studies. Cronbach's alpha confirmed internal consistency. Female participants scored higher on the RSG (Relationship with Someone or Something Greater), RG (Relationship with God), and EX (Existential) scales, and on Global-SWB. Patients with breast and gynecological tumors scored higher on RG. Older patients scored lower on RSG, RG and EX. Retirees and those with below-average incomes scored lower on EX. Participants who identified as having no religion scored lower on RSG. Stage I cancer patients scored higher on RG. The Croatian version of the EORTC QLQ-SWB32 is an acceptable, valid, and reliable measure of SWB for Croatian cancer patients.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","International journal of environmental research and public health","18","22","N/A","2025-11-04 11:50:11","2025-11-04 11:50:11"

To further examine the effects of IGF-1 on hematopoietic cells, FDC-P1 cells were infected with a retroviral construct (LISN) containing the human IGF-1 receptor (hIGF-1R) and neo genes. IL-3-independent cells were readily isolated after LISN infection when either IGF-1 or supraphysiologic concentrations of insulin were included in the culture medium. These cells were transformed to IL-3 independence by a ligand-dependent mechanism because their growth was dependent on the presence of either IGF-1 or insulin and growth factors capable of supporting autocrine growth were not detected. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the human IGF-1R (alpha IR-3) inhibited IGF-1 but not IL-3-induced proliferation and these cells contained 20- to 200-fold more IGF-1 receptors than uninfected FDC-P1 cells. In contrast, when LISN-infected cells were plated in medium without exogenously supplied IGF-1 or insulin, factor-independent cells were rarely isolated. Growth of these cells was also inhibited by the alpha IR-3 MoAb and they expressed 100- to 400-fold more IGF-1 receptors than uninfected FDC-P1 cells. The endogenous IGF-1 and/or insulin present in the calf serum may have enabled their growth because these cells, unlike the parental cells, would proliferate in serum-free defined media and their growth was again inhibited by the alpha IR-3 MoAb. These results demonstrate that IGF-1 can replace IL-3 for growth when FDC-P1 cells overexpress the IGF-1R. Given the fairly ubiquitous expression of the IGF-1 receptor, these and additional experiments might help to determine whether increased expression of endogenous receptors by cells can lead to leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis. Moreover, hIGF-1R-infected cells will be useful in investigating the mechanisms of IGF1-mediated signal transduction because they are now known to proliferate in response to IGF-1.","Blood","Blood","78","4","921-9","2025-11-04 11:50:12","2025-11-04 11:50:12"

Two microdialysis probes were inserted into the bilateral striata of Wistar rats. NG-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) with or without L-arginine was topically administered into the unilateral striatum through one of the microdialysis probes, while Ringer's solution was perfused into the contralateral striatum as the control, and 14 minutes of forebrain ischemia was applied. The extracellular glutamate concentration during ischemia and subsequent reperfusion was statistically significantly higher on the 100 microM L-NNA-perfused side than on the control side, but 1 mM L-NNA was ineffective. When 100 microM L-NNA was perfused together with 500 microM L-arginine, the glutamate concentration did not differ from that on the control side. Moreover, administration of 500 microM L-arginine significantly suppressed the glutamate elevation after reperfusion. The fact that the lower dose of L-NNA increased the accumulation of glutamate during ischemia and reperfusion without altering blood flow may indicate that nitric oxide affords protection against ischemia neuronal damage. However, since the higher dose of L-NNA did not affect the glutamate concentration, it appears that the effect of nitric oxide on extracellular glutamate concentration in forebrain ischemia differs, depending on the degree of the inhibition of NOS activity.","Brain Res","Brain research","738","2","243-8","2025-11-04 11:50:18","2025-11-04 11:50:18"

This study aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the salivary gland by a metabolomics approach in an extensive aging mouse model, SAMP1/Klotho -/- mice. We found that the salivary secretion of SAMP1/Klotho -/- mice was dramatically decreased compared with that of SAMP1/Klotho WT (+/+) mice. Metabolomics profiling analysis showed that the level of acetylcholine was significantly decreased in SAMP1/Klotho -/- mice, although the corresponding levels of acetylcholine precursors, acetyl-CoA and choline, increased. Interestingly, the mRNA and protein expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which is responsible for catalyzing acetylcholine synthesis, was significantly decreased in SAMP1/Klotho -/- mice. The overexpression of ChAT induced the expression of salivary gland functional markers (α-amylase, ZO-1, and Aqua5) in primary cultured salivary gland cells from SAMP1/Klotho +/+ and -/- mice. In an in vivo study, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-ChAT transduction significantly increased saliva secretion compared with the control in SAMP1/Klotho -/- mice. These results suggest that the dysfunction in acetylcholine biosynthesis induced by ChAT reduction may cause impaired salivary gland function.","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","22","1","N/A","2025-11-04 11:50:19","2025-11-04 11:50:19"

Several classes of gene regulators associate with the nuclear matrix in a cell type, cell growth, or cell cycle related-manner. To understand control of nuclear matrix-transcription factor interactions during tissue development, we systematically analyzed the subnuclear partitioning of a panel of transcription factors (including NMP-1/YY-1, NMP-2/AML, AP-1, and SP-1) during osteoblast differentiation using biochemical fractionation and gel shift analyses. We show that nuclear matrix association of the tissue-specific AML transcription factor NMP-2, but not the ubiquitous transcription factor YY1, is developmentally upregulated during osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, we show that there are multiple AML isoforms in mature osteoblasts, consistent with the multiplicity of AML factors that are derived from different genes and alternatively spliced cDNAs. These AML isoforms include proteins derived from the AML-3 gene and partition between distinct subcellular compartments. We conclude that the selective partitioning of the YY1 and AML transcription factors with the nuclear matrix involves a discriminatory mechanism that targets different classes and specific isoforms of gene regulatory factors to the nuclear matrix at distinct developmental stages. Our results are consistent with a role for the nuclear matrix in regulating the expression of bone-tissue specific genes during development of the mature osteocytic phenotype.","J Cell Biochem","Journal of cellular biochemistry","66","1","123-32","2025-11-04 11:50:20","2025-11-04 11:50:20"

Concentrations of soil Cr, Zn and Cu exceeded the European Union maximum permissible concentrations. Deep groundwater Cr concentration in one location exceeded the Bangladesh DoE maximum limits; however, deep groundwater is overall of good-to-excellent quality. Spatial variations of soil and groundwater contamination in Hazaribagh indicate that contaminants have not spread laterally. Based on local conditions, current technologies, contamination level, time and cost, and ease of operation, it is suggested that soil flushing, electrokinetics and/or phytoremediation could be options for remediation of affected soil and groundwater in the Hazaribagh district.","Environ Geochem Health","Environmental geochemistry and health","42","7","1905-1920","2025-11-04 11:50:21","2025-11-04 11:50:21"

Here, we compare the neighborhood of orthologous genes (within a window of 2 MB) in human and chimpanzee with the expression levels of their transcripts from several equivalent tissues and demonstrate that genes with altered neighborhood are more likely to undergo expression divergence than genes with conserved neighborhood. We observe the same trend when expression divergence data were analyzed from six different brain parts that are equivalent between human and chimpanzee. Additionally, we find enrichment for genes with altered neighborhood to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the human brain. These results suggest that expression divergence induced by this mechanism could have contributed to the phenotypic differences between human and chimpanzee.

The antitumor effect of LCL-161 was determined using luminescent adenosine triphosphate assays, flow cytometry, SCID mouse xenografts, and ex vivo patient biopsy sample studies. In vitro exposure to LCL-161 also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in IAP levels, along with synergistic enhancement of the antitumor effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy, in rituximab-sensitive cell lines and RRCLs. In addition, LCL-161 increased the cytotoxic effect of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in ex vivo lymphoma patient samples.

BCS and radiotherapy (RT) of the conserved breast became widely accepted in the last decades for the treatment of early invasive breast cancer. The standard technique of RT after breast conservation is to treat the whole breast up to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy. However, there is no consensus among radiation oncologists about the necessity of boost dose to the tumor bed. Generally accepted criteria for identification of high risk subgroups, in which boost is recommended, have not been established yet. Further controversy exists regarding the optimal boost technique (electron vs. brachytherapy), and their impact on local tumor control and cosmesis. Based on the results of numerous retrospective and recently published prospective trials, the European brachytherapy society (GEC-ESTRO), as well as the American Brachytherapy Society has issued their guidelines in these topics. These guidelines will help clinicians in their medical decisions. Some aspects of boost irradiation still remain somewhat controversial. The final results of prospective boost trials with longer follow-up, involving analyses based on pathologically defined subgroups, will clarify these controversies. Preliminary results with recently developed boost techniques (intraoperative RT, CT-image based 3D conformal brachytherapy, and 3D virtual brachytherapy) are promising.

Most of the recently introduced cerebral monitoring modalities, such as brain tissue partial oxygen tension monitoring and cerebral microdialysis, offer new opportunities by providing regional information on the specific brain area in which the probe is inserted. Ideally, these probes should be inserted in that area of the brain that is most vulnerable to ischaemia, but that may be salvageable with appropriate therapy. In this case, the combination of global and regional cerebral monitoring might offer the best information on which to base patient management. Also, the introduction of more clinically useful, functional neuroimaging techniques may be a valuable adjunct to future neurological critical care management.","Curr Opin Anaesthesiol","Current opinion in anaesthesiology","13","5","517-21","2025-11-04 11:50:27","2025-11-04 11:50:27"

AI-2 is synthesized, released and later internalized in a cell-density dependent manner. Here, by mutational analysis of the genes, uvrY and csrA, we describe a regulatory circuit of accumulation and uptake of AI-2. We constructed a single-copy chromosomal luxS-lacZ fusion in a luxS + merodiploid strain and evaluated its relative expression in uvrY and csrA mutants. At the entry of stationary phase, the expression of the fusion and AI-2 accumulation was positively regulated by uvrY and negatively regulated by csrA respectively. A deletion of csrA altered message stability of the luxS transcript and CsrA protein exhibited weak binding to 5' luxS regulatory region. DNA protein interaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed direct interaction of UvrY with the luxS promoter. Additionally, reduced expression of the fusion in hfq deletion mutant suggested involvement of small RNA interactions in luxS regulation. In contrast, the expression of lsrA operon involved in AI-2 uptake, is negatively regulated by uvrY and positively by csrA in a cell-density dependent manner. The dual role of csrA in AI-2 synthesis and uptake suggested a regulatory crosstalk of cell signaling with carbon regulation in Escherichia coli. We found that the cAMP-CRP mediated catabolite repression of luxS expression was uvrY dependent. This study suggests that luxS expression is complex and regulated at the level of transcription and translation. The multifactorial regulation supports the notion that cell-cell communication requires interaction and integration of multiple metabolic signals.","PLoS One","PloS one","11","6","e0157532","2025-11-04 11:50:28","2025-11-04 11:50:28"

Depending on the impact energy and the depth of the ocean, a large amount of water is displaced, forming a temporary crater in the water column. Large tsunami-like waves originate from the collapse of the cavity in the water and the ejecta splash. Because of the far-reaching destructive consequences of such waves, an oceanic impact has been suggested to be more severe than a similar-sized impact on land; in other words, oceanic impacts may punch over their weight. This review paper summarizes the process of impact-induced wave generation and subsequent propagation, whether the wave characteristic differs from tsunamis generated by other classical mechanisms, and what methods have been applied to quantify the consequences of an oceanic impact. Finally, the impact-induced tsunami hazard will be evaluated by means of the Eltanin impact event.","Philos Trans A Math Phys Eng Sci","Philosophical transactions.

Data from the literature indicate that, in general, endothelial dysfunction would not be the cause of experimental hypertension and may rather be secondary, that is, resulting from high blood pressure (BP). The initial mechanism of endothelial dysfunction itself may be associated with a lack of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (mainly nitric oxide) and/or accentuation of various endothelium-derived constricting factors. The involvement and role of endothelium-derived factors in the development of endothelial dysfunction in individual experimental models of hypertension may vary, depending on the triggering stimulus, strain, age, and vascular bed investigated. This brief review was focused on the participation of endothelial dysfunction, individual endothelium-derived factors, and their mechanisms of action in the development of high BP in the most frequently used rodent experimental models of arterial hypertension, including nitric oxide deficient models, spontaneous (pre)hypertension, stress-induced hypertension, and selected pharmacological and diet-induced models.","Biomed Res Int","BioMed research international","2014","N/A","598271","2025-11-04 11:50:30","2025-11-04 11:50:30"

The paper reports on the thermal behaviour of wild type NiR from Alcaligenes faecalis S-6. The temperature-induced changes of the copper centres are characterized by optical spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and by establishing the thermal stability by differential scanning calorimetry. The calorimetric profile of the enzyme shows a single endothermic peak with maximum heat absorption at T(m) approximately 100 degrees C, revealing an exceptional thermal stability. The thermal transition is irreversible and the scan rate dependence of the calorimetric trace indicates that the denaturation of NiR is kinetically controlled. The divergence of the activation energy values determined by different methods is used as a criterion for the inapplicability of the one-step irreversible model. The best fit of the DSC profiles is obtained when the classical Lumry-Eyring model, N<-->U-->F, is considered. The simulation results indicate that the irreversible step prevails on the reversible one. Moreover, it is found that the conformational changes within the type-1 copper environments precede the denaturation of the whole protein. No evidence of protein dissociation within the temperature range investigated was observed.","Biochim Biophys Acta","Biochimica et biophysica acta","1752","1","47-55","2025-11-04 11:50:31","2025-11-04 11:50:31"

Among different types of taste, bitter taste is the most relevant for patient acceptance because of the extremely high sensitivity. As hydrolysis is the most common mode of degradation of an active ingredient, moisture protection plays a vital role in the stability of the active during manufacturing and storage. Optimized oral dosage forms need to reliably hinder the release of bitter drug molecules in the mouth or ensure stability of the active compound, while also ensuring fast drug release in the stomach to enable early therapeutic onset. Besides different formulation concepts, film coating is found to be the most effective and commonly used approach for taste masking and moisture protection. Film coating can be achieved through the use of water-soluble, cationic, anionic or neutral insoluble polymers from different chemical structures. Cationic polymers provide efficient moisture protection as well as taste masking without influencing the release of the drug in the gastric fluids. Polymers may be sprayed onto various types of cores from dispersions or solutions in organic, solvents or water in drum or fluidzed bed coaters. Applied quantities need insuring complete coating thickness ranging from 0.5 to 50 μm or more finally. Insulating excipients, such as hydrophobic plasticizers, lipids, pigments or other insoluble substances will influence the functionality of films. Organoleptic tests are still common in testing the quality of taste-masked formulations. Recently, multi-channel taste sensors have been developed to quantify different types of taste. Dynamic vapor sorption technique and studies at elevated temperature provide effective concepts study the efficacy of the formulations. Efficient taste masking and reliable moisture protection of solid oral dosage forms can be achieved by film coating implementing the options of pharmaceutical polymers and processes.","Int J Pharm","International journal of pharmaceutics","457","2","395-406","2025-11-04 11:50:37","2025-11-04 11:50:37"

A case-control study was therefore performed to determine whether prior use of non-steroidal and other anti-inflammatory compounds was associated with an increased case fatality rate from complications of peptic ulcer. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used by 39% of a series of 80 patients who had died from peptic ulcer complications and by 37% of 160 controls who were survivors matched for sex, age, ulcer site, and nature of complication (odds ratio 1.1; 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 2.1). Similarly, the rates of prior use of aspirin by cases and controls were almost identical (odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.9). Thus neither nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nor aspirin were associated with increased case fatality rates from peptic ulcer complications. In contrast, corticosteroids were associated with an increased mortality (odds ratio 4.2; 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 25.6). Although this increase in the estimated relative risk was not statistically significant, a review of the case records indicated that most deaths in steroid users were due to serious sepsis, indicating that there might be a causal association between use of the drugs and the mode of death.","Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)","British medical journal (Clinical research ed.)","295","6608","1227-9","2025-11-04 11:50:38","2025-11-04 11:50:38"

We demonstrate the importance of accounting for the sequence of extreme days. We also disentangle the impacts of those extremes by age and gender. The findings suggest that single hot days increase mortality, while single cold days do not affect mortality. On the other hand, both consecutive hot and consecutive cold days increase mortality in females and males for all age groups, although males are affected more severely. Overall, consecutive days with extreme temperatures impose considerable costs to society in terms of years of life lost. Thus, ignoring the sequences of extreme days that are likely to increase in the future because of climate change may have critical implications for mitigation policies.","Econ Hum Biol","Economics and human biology","31","N/A","249-258","2025-11-04 11:50:39","2025-11-04 11:50:39"

In addition, the cell viability, proliferation and invasion abilities were determined in two gastric cancer cell lines, NCI‑N87 and MGC80‑3, that were transfected with miR‑132 mimics or antisense oligos. It was found that miR‑132 expression was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues when compared with adjacent non‑cancerous tissues. At the molecular level, the data demonstrated that miR‑132 inhibits the protein levels of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) by targeting the 3'‑untranslated region.

Several parameters were optimized to improve preparation and separation time while still maintaining high sensitivity. Validation tests of spiked samples showed good linearities for 27 pesticides (R = 0.9909-0.9996) over wide concentration ranges. Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were measured at ng/L levels, 0.06-2 ng/L and 0.2-6 ng/L for OCPs and 0.02-3 ng/L and 0.06-7 ng/L for PYPs, respectively. Inter- and intra-day precision tests showed variations of 0.65-9.89% for OCPs and 0.98-13.99% for PYPs, respectively. Average recoveries were in the range of 47.74-120.31%, with relative standard deviations below 20%. The developed method was then applied to analyze 80 CM wine samples. Beta-BHC (Benzene hexachloride) was the most frequently detected pesticide at concentration levels of 5.67-31.55 mg/L, followed by delta-BHC, trans-chlordane, gamma-BHC, and alpha-BHC. The validated method is simple and economical, with adequate sensitivity for trace levels of multi-class pesticides. It could be adopted by laboratories for this and other types of complex matrices analysis.","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","6","N/A","21558","2025-11-04 11:50:45","2025-11-04 11:50:45"

However, no detailed study on patients with aortic prosthesis is available. Thus, RPV usefulness is left as an anecdotical notion in this context. We aimed to define feasibility and clinical-impact of RPV before and soon-after percutaneous implantation (TAVI) or surgical (SAVR) aortic-valve-replacement (AVR) for AS. Patients with severe-AS electively referred for AVR between September-2019 and February-2020 were prospectively evaluated. Echocardiographic examinations inclusive of apical and RPV to measure aortic-peak-velocity , gradients and area (AVA) were performed the day before AVR and at hospital discharge and compared by matched-pair-analysis. Forty-seven patients (mean age 79 ± 8 years, 63% female, ejection-fraction 61 ± 6%) referred for SAVR (24 [51%]) or TAVI (23 [49%]) were enrolled. RPV was feasible in 45 patients (96%) before-AVR but in only 32 after-AVR (68%), particularly after SAVR (50%) than TAVI (87% p = 0.005). RPV remained the best acoustic window after TAVI in 75% of cases.

Five (11%) patients presented severe patient-prosthesis-mismatch, 4 of which were detectable only by RPV. This pilot-experience demonstrates that RPV feasibility is slightly reduced after AVR. RPV can improve the hemodynamic assessment of the prosthetic valve versus apical view, including the detection of patient-prosthesis-mismatch. Furthermore, when RPV is the best acoustic windows in patients with severe AS, it generally remains so after-TAVI.","Am J Cardiol","The American journal of cardiology","142","N/A","103-108","2025-11-04 11:50:47","2025-11-04 11:50:47"

All schedules generated similar overall reinforcement rates. A peak in local response rate occurred several seconds after reinforcement under those schedules where reinforcement rate at this time was moderate or high ([i], [ii], and [iv]). Later in the inter-reinforcement interval, local response rate was roughly constant under those schedules with a constant local reinforcement rate ([i], [ii], and [iii]), but increased steadily when local reinforcement rate increased with time since reinforcement ([iv] and [v]). Postreinforcement pauses occurred on all schedules, but were much longer when local reinforcement rate was very low in the ten seconds after reinforcement ([iii]). The interresponse time distribution was highly correlated with the distribution of reinforced interresponse times, and the distribution of postreinforcement pauses was highly correlated with the distribution of reinforced postreinforcement pauses on some schedules. However, there was no direct evidence that these correlations resulted from selective reinforcement of classes of interresponse times and pauses.","J Exp Anal Behav","Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior","35","1","45-53","2025-11-04 11:50:49","2025-11-04 11:50:49"

In rodents, however, few behavioral and physical assessments have been conducted in both sexes within the same study. The current article documents data obtained from young and aged rats of both sexes that performed a battery of cognitive and physical assessments to examine for potential interactions between sex and age. Physical performance was measured with a rotarod test of motor coordination, assessment of maximum grip strength, and swim speed. While females outperformed males in rotarod and grip strength, there was also an age-dependent decline in physical performance in both sexes. Cognitive assessments included the Morris watermaze test of hippocampal dependent spatial memory and a biconditional association task with a working memory (WM) component, both of which were not significantly different across sex. Notably, a cognitive dual task that simultaneously tests working memory (WM) and biconditional association task (BAT) acquisition has previously been shown to be more sensitive to age-related cognitive decline than the watermaze in male rats, which is replicated here in both female and male rats. Furthermore, young and aged females (<27 months) spent a similar percent of time in each estrus cycle phase and phase did not influence WM/BAT performance. Future studies utilizing similar behavioral paradigms to examine the neurobiology of cognitive aging should be representative of the human population they intend to model through the inclusion of female subjects.

Masses of 12 non-parasitized freshly laid (less than 24 h old) eggs were exposed to 2-5 days old mated females with previous oviposition experience (n = 10). Behaviour was observed for 2 h under the stereomicroscope. The eggs were Then kept individually at 25 degrees +/- 1 degree C/12 h photophase till hatching. The mean number of parasitized eggs was 7.8 +/- 0.81 (mean +/- SE). Five distinct kinds of behaviour were observed: drumming with antennae on the eggs, ovipositor insertion, egg marking, walking and resting. On average, ovipositor insertion was not followed by marking 4.3 +/- 0.76 times per female. In nearly all of these events, parasitism was unsuccessful. Walking and resting were observed less frequently than the other behaviours (1.6 +/- 0.56 and 2.1 +/- 0.48 times/female, respectively). Superparasitism occurred on average 3.6 +/- 0.88 times per egg mass, with 2.7 +/- 0.57 eggs being superparasitized. Among these, on average 87.4 +/- 5.37% led to successful development of an adult parasitoid. The average time spent on the each kind of oviposition behaviour was 1.5 +/- 0.57 min for drumming, 3.9 +/- 0.56 min for ovipositor insertion and 0.4 +/- 0.06 min for marking. There was no significant variation on the duration of each behaviour as the parasitoid progressed in parasitizing an egg mass. Ovipositor insertion almost always (87.58%) occurred in the longitudinal extremities of the egg. In average 31.1 +/- 7.21% of the individual emerging per egg mass were males, the larger proportion of males originating from the 2nd oviposition. The results show a range of oviposition behaviours common to the Scelionidae family. Egg marking behaviour was a good indicator of the effective oviposition by females. Superparasitism is only partially avoided, but its occurrence does not imply a failure of parasitoid emergence. The sex ratio is skewed towards females, and most males come from the first ovipositions.","Braz J Biol","Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia","63","1","133-9","2025-11-04 11:50:50","2025-11-04 11:50:50"

The morphometric parameters obtained were oocyte diameter, perivitelline space width, zona pellucida thickness, and first polar body diameter. The median oocyte diameter was similar in cases in which fertilization occurred compared with those in which fertilization failed (75.2 and 75.9 μm, respectively; P = .218). The 2 groups also had similar measurements of perivitelline space, zona pellucida, and first polar body. However, the best quality zygotes identified by a morphological score resulted from oocytes with larger diameter (75.6 vs 74.0 μm; P < .01) and narrow perivitelline space (5.3 vs 7.1 μm; P < .01). Embryo development, as assessed by cleavage at second day of culture, was not significantly associated with oocyte morphometric parameters.

Each complex has distinct and important roles in chromatin dynamics, gene expression and differentiation. In yeast and Drosophila, Smc6 is involved in recombinational repair, restarting collapsed replication forks and prevention of recombination in repetitive sequences such as rDNA and pericentromeric heterochromatin. Although such DNA damage control mechanisms, as well as highly dynamic changes in chromatin composition and function, are essential for gametogenesis, knowledge on Smc6 function in mammalian systems is limited. We therefore have investigated the role of Smc6 during mammalian spermatogonial differentiation, meiosis and subsequent spermiogenesis. We found that, during mouse spermatogenesis, Smc6 functions as part of meiotic pericentromeric heterochromatin domains that are initiated when differentiating spermatogonia become irreversibly committed toward meiosis. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide insight into how commitment toward meiosis alters chromatin structure and dynamics, thereby setting apart differentiating spermatogonia from the undifferentiated spermatogonia, including the spermatogonial stem cells. Interestingly, Smc6 is not essential for spermatogonial mitosis, whereas Smc6-negative meiotic cells appear unable to finish their first meiotic division. Importantly, during meiosis, we find that DNA repair or recombination sites, marked by γH2AX or Rad51 respectively, do not co-localize with the pericentromeric heterochromatin domains where Smc6 is located. Considering the repetitive nature of these domains and that Smc6 has been previously shown to prevent recombination in repetitive sequences, we hypothesize that Smc6 has a role in the prevention of aberrant recombination events between pericentromeric regions during the first meiotic prophase that would otherwise cause chromosomal aberrations leading to apoptosis, meiotic arrest or aneuploidies.","Cell Death Dis","Cell death & disease","4","8","e749","2025-11-04 11:50:53","2025-11-04 11:50:53"

The optimum time delay for different subjects varied from 3 to 9 samples. False nearest neighbors method was used to obtain proper embedding dimension. The correlation dimension was calculated based on Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm. The results suggest that swallowing sound is well characterized by a small number of dimensions. The largest Lyapunov exponent was also estimated to evaluate the presence of chaos. As the largest Lyapunov exponent for some cases was negative, it may be concluded that swallowing sound is not necessarily a chaotic process.","Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc","Conference proceedings : ...

To this purpose, resveratrol derivatives, in which all or each single hydroxylic function were selectively substituted with methyl groups, were synthesized. Analogues with the stilbenic double bond reduced or with the stereoisometry modified were also investigated. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of citronellal thermo-oxidation, or the reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. In addition, the protection against lipid peroxidation was determined in rat liver microsomes, and in human primary cell cultures. The antiproliferative activity was evaluated by a clonogenic assay, and by analysis of cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis. The results showed that the hydroxyl group in 4' position is not the sole determinant for antioxidant activity. In contrast, the presence of 4'-OH together with stereoisometry in the trans-conformation (4'-hydroxystyryl moiety) was absolutely required for inhibition of cell proliferation.

The investigation focused on whether MFWE inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) E2 productions, as well as the expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interleukin (IL)-6, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

There were number of papers published on isolation and identification of new saponins by chromatographic techniques. Some new developments can be found in separation techniques or solid and mobiles phases used. Separation of individual saponins is still complicated and time consuming. This is due to the fact that in most of the plant species saponins occur as a multi-component mixture of compounds of very similar polarities. Thus, to isolate single compound for structure elucidation or biological activity testing, a combination of different chromatographic techniques has to be used, e.g. first separation of the mixture to simpler sub-fractions on reversed phase C18 has to be followed by further purification on normal phase Silica gel column. Especially difficult is determination of saponins in plant material as these compounds do not possess chromophores and their profiles cannot be registered in UV. Most HPLC methods apply not only specific registration at 200-210 nm, but these methods are not applicable for determination of many saponins in plant material at levels lower than 200-300 mg/kg. Some new or improved techniques for quantification of saponins in plant material were published in reviewed period. These include further progress in the application of evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) for saponin profiling and quantification, which is also not only specific but also more sensitive in comparison to 200-210 nm detection. Some progress in development of new applications for liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS) for saponin determination has also been done. This method gives highest sensitivity and on line identification of separated saponins and should be recommended for specialized analyses of extracts and pharmaceutical formulas like the validation of a new assay. From non-chromatographic techniques for saponin determination, a sensitive and compound specific ELISA tests for some saponins were developed.","J Chromatogr A","Journal of chromatography.

The country has very limited human and financial resources and, when the outbreak first began, the veterinary services were not equipped with the basic tools to collect accurate epidemiological information or to fight the disease. Therefore, different agencies, under the umbrella of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, are providing support to the Government to strengthen its capacity to diagnose, survey and control the avian influenza (AI) virus. Different surveillance tools are being tested, such as market monitoring and a sentinel villages' network, to offset the weakness of the national passive surveillance network. Several constraints were identified during the implementation of this programme, such as a lack of motivation among provincial staff, the limited capacity of the central team to compile and analyse the data generated, the reluctance of farmers to have their animals sampled, and weak diagnostic capacities. The sustainability of such a surveillance system once international support ends remains to be seen. Participatory epidemiology (PE) may be an appropriate complementary tool to track diseases.

The Caribbean Sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, produces two pore-forming toxins, Sticholysin I (St I) and Stichloysin II (St II), with the ability to form oligomeric pores in cell and lipid bilayers characteristically lacking cysteine in their amino acid sequences. Recently, two mutants of a recombinant variant of Sticholysin I (rSt I) have been obtained with a Cys residue in functionally relevant regions for the pore-forming activity of the toxin: r St I F15C (in the amino terminal sequence) and r St I R52C (in the binding site). Aiming at characterizing the effects of oxidants in toxins devoid (r St I) or containing -SH moieties (r St I F15C and r St I R52C), we measured their hemolytic activity and pore forming capacity prior and after their incubation with peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). At low ONOO(-)/Toxin ratios, nearly 0.8 Trp groups are modified by each added peroxynitrite molecule, and the toxin activity is reduced in ca. 20 %. On the other hand, in -SH bearing mutants only 0.5 Trp groups are modified by each peroxynitrite molecule and the toxin activity is only reduced in 10 %. The results indicated that Cys is the initial target of the oxidative damage and that Trp residues in Cys-containing toxins were less damaged than those in r St I. This relative protection of Trp groups correlates with a smaller loss of hemolytic activity and permeabilization ability in liposomes and emphasizes the relevance of Trp groups in the pore forming capacity of the toxins.","Protein J","The protein journal","33","5","493-501","2025-11-04 11:51:09","2025-11-04 11:51:09"

Kinetic data is consistent with proteins being a major target for (1)O(2), with damage occurring preferentially at Trp, His, Tyr, Met, and Cys side-chains. Reaction with each of these residues gives rise to further reactive species. In the case of Trp and Tyr, initial poorly characterised endoperoxides are believed to undergo ring-opening reactions to give hydroperoxides, which can be reduced to the corresponding alcohols; other products arising from radical intermediates can also be generated, particularly in the presence of UV light and metal ions. With His side-chains, poorly characterised peroxides are also formed. Reaction with Met and Cys has been proposed to occur via zwitterionic peroxy intermediates. Peroxides are also generated on isolated proteins, and protein within intact cells, via(1)O(2)-mediated reactions. The peroxides formed on Trp, Tyr, and His peptides, as well as on proteins, have been shown to induce damage to other targets, with molecular oxidation of thiol residues an important reaction. This can result in the inactivation of cellular enzymes and the oxidation of other biological targets. Protein cross-linking and aggregation can also be induced by reactive species formed on photo-oxidised proteins, though the nature of the species that participate in such reactions is poorly understood. These secondary reactions, and particularly those involving hydroperoxides, may play a key role in the induction of secondary damage (bystander effects) in systems subject to photo-oxidation.","Photochem Photobiol Sci","Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology","3","1","17-25","2025-11-04 11:51:10","2025-11-04 11:51:10"

Three groups of pregnant Wistar rats were used: 1) Control, treated with saline solution; 2) treated with 100 mg/kg OXC; 3) treated with 100 mg/kg of carbamazepine (CBZ, as a positive control for apoptosis); the route of administration was intragastric. Apoptosis was detected at three postnatal ages using the TUNEL technique in the CA1, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and in the dentate gyrus (DG); neurogenesis was assessed in the DG using an antibody against doublecortin. The litter characteristics were recorded. OXC increased apoptosis in all regions (p < 0.01) at the three ages evaluated. Lamination disruption occurred in CA1 and CA3 due to the neuron absence and to ectopic neurons; there were also malformations in the dorsal lamina of the DG in 38% and 25% of the pups born from rats treated with OXC and CBZ respectively. CBZ also increased apoptosis. No clear effect on neurogenesis in the DG was observed. The size of the litter was smaller (p < 0.01) in the experimental groups.

Twenty four patients hospitalized in the Department of Neurotraumatology, Collegium Medicum of the Jagiellonian University were compared with a control group of 16 healthy volunteers matched for gender and age. Their gastric myoelectric activity was measured using standard cutaneous electrodes with Synectics, a Swedish system of data storage and analysis. Results of the study were analyzed at the Department of Pathophysiology, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University. In the electrogastrography (EGG) recording of the control group the proportions of time with bradygastria (0.5-2 cpm), normogastria (2-4 cpm) and tachygastria (4-10 cpm) were 11.6 +/- 8%, 86.2 +/- 9% and 2.16 +/- 1.5% respectively. The signal amplitude was 181 +/- 11.5 microV2. In patients with a severe head injury followed by intracranial hypertension III degree and cerebral coma (the Glasgow Coma Scale score 4-7 points), the proportion of bradygastria in the total recording time amounted to 46.5 +/- 8%. In these patients also the signal amplitude was found to increase up to 766 microV2 (p = 0.0007). Our results indicate that in patients comatose due to a posttraumatic brainstem injury, the function of the brain-gut link is altered. There is a severe disorder of the upper gut motility, associated with gastric dysrhythmia--bradygastria resulting from an increased cholinergic output. This leads to intestinal feeding intolerance.","Neurol Neurochir Pol","Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska","37","5","1037-45","2025-11-04 11:51:15","2025-11-04 11:51:15"

Forty-five GH-secreting adenomas were examined for the presence of point mutations in codons 201 or 227 of the Gs alpha gene using the polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing method and deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. Mutation of codon 227 of the Gs alpha gene was not observed in any of the tumors, but a mis-sense mutation of codon 201 was identified in two tumors (4.4%). One lesion was a densely granulated GH cell adenoma in a patient with adenomatous goiter and breast cancer. The other was a mixed GH cell-prolactin cell adenoma in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 associated with parathyroid hyperplasia and a pancreatic islet cell tumor. The Gs alpha gene detected in parathyroid tissue and pancreatic tumor tissue was of the wild type in this second patient, and the mutation was specific to the pituitary tumor. These results suggest that point mutations of codons 201 or 227 of the Gs alpha gene may not be important mediators of oncogenesis for GH-secreting pituitary adenomas in Japan.","Acta Endocrinol (Copenh)","Acta endocrinologica","129","4","301-6","2025-11-04 11:51:15","2025-11-04 11:51:15"

We have previously shown that ferritin can bind high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). Upon proteolytic cleavage by the protease kallikrein, HK releases the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin (BK) and other biologically active products, such as two-chain high-molecular-weight kininogen, HKa. At inflammatory sites, HK is oxidized, which renders it a poor substrate for kallikrein. However, oxidized HK remains a good substrate for elastase and tryptase, thereby providing an alternative cleavage mechanism for HK during inflammation. Here we report that ferritin can retard the cleavage of both native HK and oxidized HK by elastase and tryptase. Initial rates of cleavage were reduced 45-75% in the presence of ferritin. Ferritin is not a substrate for elastase or tryptase and does not interfere with the ability of either protease to digest a synthetic substrate, suggesting that ferritin may impede HK cleavage through direct interaction with HK. Immunoprecipitation and solid phase binding studies reveal that ferritin and HK bind directly with a Kd of 134 nM. To test whether ferritin regulates HK cleavage in vivo, we used THP-1 cells, a human monocyte/macrophage cell line that has been used to model pulmonary inflammatory cells. We observed that ferritin impedes the cleavage of HK by secretory proteases in stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, ferritin, HK, and elastase are all present in or on alveolar macrophages in a mouse model of pulmonary inflammation. Collectively, these results implicate ferritin in the modulation of HK cleavage at sites of inflammation.","Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","American journal of physiology.

Recent publications, however, have reported an increased risk of lymphoma in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with immunomodulatory TNF-alpha blockers. To assess the role of TNF-alpha in neoplasia, a review of TNF-alpha effects on experimental and human cancer and the influence of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on cancer development was conducted. TNF-alpha produces a variety of cellular responses which, with sustained increased levels of activity, could either facilitate or inhibit tumorigenesis. In experimental models, most evidence supports the potential enhancement of neoplasia by TNF-alpha. The increased frequency of lymphoma that has been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF-alpha therapy may reflect the severity of the disease, which could be associated with greater TNF-alpha activity. Skin cancer is also reported to be increased in some studies. Other findings, to the contrary, suggest that TNF-alpha inhibition could impede tumorigenesis. It is concluded that the presently available data do not permit a robust conclusion on the potential effects of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on the risk of human neoplasia, but reduction in neoplasia seems probable. Further investigation of this important topic is clearly warranted.","Eur J Cancer Prev","European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP)","17","2","169-77","2025-11-04 11:51:19","2025-11-04 11:51:19"

This study was designed to characterize the gut microbiota with regard to the presence of genes encoding tetracycline resistance proteins (tet) in the gut of healthy exclusively breast-fed infants and their mothers. For this purpose we determined the prevalence of genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins (tet M, tet W, tet O, tet S, tet T and tet B) by PCR and characterized the gut microbiota by FISH in stools of infants and their mothers. The gene tet M was found in all the breast-fed infants and their mothers. tet O was found in all of the mothers' samples, whilst only 35% of the infants harboured this gene. tet W was less frequently found (85% of the mothers and 13% of the infants).

Many researchers employ the Kapetanios test which has a unit root as the null and a stationary nonlinear model as the alternative. However this test statistics is based on the assumption of normally distributed errors in the DGP. Cook has analyzed the size of the nonlinear unit root of this test in the presence of heavy-tailed innovation process and obtained the critical values for both finite variance and infinite variance cases. However the test statistics of Cook are oversized. It has been found by researchers that using conventional tests is dangerous though the best performance among these is a HCCME. The over sizing for LM tests can be reduced by employing fixed design wild bootstrap remedies which provide a valuable alternative to the conventional tests. In this paper the size of the Kapetanios test statistic employing hetroscedastic consistent covariance matrices has been derived and the results are reported for various sample sizes in which size distortion is reduced. The properties for estimates of ESTAR models have been investigated when errors are assumed non-normal. We compare the results obtained through the fitting of nonlinear least square with that of the quantile regression fitting in the presence of outliers and the error distribution was considered to be from t-distribution for various sample sizes.","PLoS One","PloS one","11","11","e0166990","2025-11-04 11:51:26","2025-11-04 11:51:26"

Numerous endocytic accessory proteins collaborate with clathrin and AP2 to drive CCV formation.

Indeed, a plethora of recent evidence derived from cell perturbation, correlative light and EM tomography, live-cell imaging, modeling, and high-resolution structural analyses has revealed more complexity and promiscuity in the protein interactions driving CCP maturation than anticipated.

Other atmospheric constituents having a significant absorption in these channels are CO(2), HNO(3), and the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) F11 and F12. The latter two only have a small effect on both channels at present but as the concentration of CFCs is increasing at ~5%/year this will increase significantly with time.","Appl Opt","Applied optics","28","19","4154-60","2025-11-04 11:51:36","2025-11-04 11:51:36"

Test on a large set of proteins.","A computational method, to predict the pKa values of the ionizable residues Asp, Glu, His, Tyr, and Lys of proteins, is presented here. Calculation of the electrostatic free-energy of the proteins is based on an efficient version of a continuum dielectric electrostatic model. The conformational flexibility of the protein is taken into account by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of 10 ns in implicit water. The accuracy of the proposed method of calculation of pKa values is estimated from a test set of experimental pKa data for 297 ionizable residues from 34 proteins. The pKa-prediction test shows that, on average, 57, 86, and 95% of all predictions have an error lower than 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 pKa units, respectively. This work contributes to our general understanding of the importance of protein flexibility for an accurate computation of pKa, providing critical insight about the significance of the multiple neutral states of acid and histidine residues for pKa-prediction, and may spur significant progress in our effort to develop a fast and accurate electrostatic-based method for pKa-predictions of proteins as a function of pH.","J Biomol Struct Dyn","Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics","36","3","561-574","2025-11-04 11:51:36","2025-11-04 11:51:36"

A conventional surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator filter requires reflectors consisting of numerous grating fingers on both sides of interdigital transducers (IDTs). On the contrary, it is considered that small-sized and low loss resonator filters without reflectors consisting of grating fingers can be realized by exploiting this characteristic of the SH wave or the Bleustein-Gulyaev-Shimizu (BGS) wave. There are two types of resonator filters: transversely coupled and longitudinally coupled. No transversely coupled filters (neither conventional nor edge-reflection) using the SH wave on a single-crystal substrate have been realized until now, because two transverse modes (symmetrical and asymmetrical modes) are not easily coupled. However, the authors have realized small low loss transversely coupled resonator filters in the range of 25 to 52 MHz using edge reflections of the BGS wave on piezoelectric ceramic (PZT: Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) substrates for the first time by developing methods by which the two transverse modes could be coupled. On the other hand, longitudinally coupled resonator filters using edge reflection of the SH or BGS wave always have large spurious responses because of the even modes in the out-of-band range, because the frequencies of even modes do not coincide with the nulls of the frequency spectra of the IDTs. Consequently, longitudinally coupled resonator filters using the edge reflection of the SH wave have not been realized. By developing a method of reducing the spurious responses without increasing of the insertion loss, the authors have realized small low loss longitudinally coupled resonator filters in the range of 40 to 190 MHz using edge reflection of BGS or SH waves on PZT or 36 degrees-rotated-Y X-propagation LiTaO3 substrates for the first time. Despite being intermediate frequency (IF) filters, their package (3 x 3 x 1.03 mm3) sizes are as small as those of radio frequency (RF) SAW filters.","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control","49","9","1269-79","2025-11-04 11:51:37","2025-11-04 11:51:37"

This study was conducted to compare the initial rate of platelet inhibition after a loading dose (LD) of prasugrel or clopidogrel and determine the association between the initial rate of inhibition and pharmacodynamic responder status. Data were pooled from 3 studies in which healthy subjects received LDs of prasugrel (60 mg; n = 76) or clopidogrel (300 mg; n = 87). Maximum platelet aggregation (MPA; 20 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate) was measured by turbidimetric aggregometry (0.25 to 24 hours after dosing). A mechanistic model was used to estimate the initial rate of decrease in MPA per hour (fast onset: MPA decrease >20%/hour). Subjects were defined as pharmacodynamic poor responders if the absolute decrease in MPA from baseline was <15% at either 4 to 5 or 24 hours after dosing. The median initial rate of decrease in MPA was greater after prasugrel (203%/hour) than with clopidogrel (23%/hour) (p <0.001). Overall, 76 subjects (100%) receiving prasugrel had fast onset of platelet inhibition compared with 47 subjects (54%) receiving clopidogrel. The initial rate of decrease in MPA was highly correlated with responder status (p <0.001). After prasugrel, subjects had a lower median MPA compared with clopidogrel (p <0.001; from >0.25 to 24 hours after dosing), and intersubject variability in MPA response was less after prasugrel compared with clopidogrel (p <0.001; from >1 to 24 hours after dosing). In conclusion, platelet inhibition after a 60-mg LD of prasugrel was more rapid in onset, less variable, and greater in magnitude than with a 300-mg LD of clopidogrel. After a thienopyridine LD, the initial rate of platelet inhibition was predictive of pharmacodynamic responder status.","Am J Cardiol","The American journal of cardiology","100","2","331-6","2025-11-04 11:51:38","2025-11-04 11:51:38"

Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: OA control group (CG); OA animals submitted to PBM treatment (PBM); OA animals submitted to CS/Gl treatment (CS/Gl); OA submitted to CS/GS associated with PBM treatments (GS/Gl + PBM). The CS/Gl started 48 h after the surgery, and they were performed for 29 consecutive days. Moreover, PBM was performed after the CS/Gl administration on the left joint. Morphological characteristics and immunoexpression of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and 1 beta (IL-1β) and collagen type II (Col II) of the articular cartilage were evaluated. The results showed that all treated groups (CS/Gl and PBM) presented attenuation signs of degenerative process (measured by histopathological analysis) and lower density chondrocytes [PBM (p = 0.0017); CS/Gl (p = 0.0153) and CS/Gl + PBM (p = 0.002)]. Additionally, CS/Gl [associated (p = 0.0089) or not with PBM (p = 0.0059)] showed significative lower values for OARSI grade evaluation. Furthermore, CS/GS + PBM decreased IL-1β protein expression (p = 0.0359) and increased IL-10 (p = 0.028) and Col II imunoexpression (p = 0.0204) compared to CG.

The natural world expresses temporal relationships at a wide range of scales. Because we cannot know the relevant scales a priori, it is desirable that memory, and thus the generated sequences, is scale invariant. Although recurrent neural network models have been proposed as a mechanism for generating sequences, the requirements for scale-invariant sequences are not known. This letter reports the constraints that enable a linear recurrent neural network model to generate scale-invariant sequential activity. A straightforward eigendecomposition analysis results in two independent conditions that are required for scale invariance for connectivity matrices with real, distinct eigenvalues. First, the eigenvalues of the network must be geometrically spaced. Second, the eigenvectors must be related to one another via translation. These constraints are easily generalizable for matrices that have complex and distinct eigenvalues. Analogous albeit less compact constraints hold for matrices with degenerate eigenvalues. These constraints, along with considerations on initial conditions, provide a general recipe to build linear recurrent neural networks that support scale-invariant sequential activity.","Neural Comput","Neural computation","32","7","1379-1407","2025-11-04 11:51:47","2025-11-04 11:51:47"

However, how the different 4E-BPs affect translation during prolonged use of mTOR inhibitors is not known. Here we show that the expression of 4E-BP3, but not that of 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2, is transcriptionally induced during prolonged mTORC1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our data reveal that 4E-BP3 expression is controlled by the transcription factor TFE3 through a cis-regulatory element in the EIF4EBP3 gene promoter. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated EIF4EBP3 gene disruption in human cancer cells mitigated the inhibition of translation and proliferation caused by prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors.

However, occasionally, it forms a mass in the extramedullary space of the vertebrae. The authors report such a rare case with plasmacytoma which formed a mass in the thoracic epidural space without evidence of involvement of the adjacent vertebra. On May 22, 1985, a 80-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with chief complaints of gait disturbance and hypesthesia below the umbilical level. Difficulty of walking developed approximately four months prior to admission with gradual aggravation and hypesthesia added thereafter. Neurological examinations at admission showed paraparesis with positive Babinski's and Chaddock's reflexes, hypesthesia and disturbances of vibration and position senses below the 9th thoracic nerve level. Myelography and CT scan using metrizamide indicated a presence of epidural mass at the 8th to 9th thoracic vertebrae. There was no abnormal bony change in the spine on plain X-ray and CT scan. On May 30, 1985, total removal of epidural tumor was performed by removing the laminae from the 7th to 10th vertebrae. Histological examinations including immunological stainings showed a plasmacytoma which produced monoclonal immunoglobulin of IgG-lambda type. Radiation therapy was not carried out. The serum protein fraction, immunoglobulin, immunoelectrophoresis, Bence-Jones protein and CSF immunoglobulin examined after operation, supported a histological diagnosis of plasmacytoma.

Translocation and processing of this chimeric preZad protein were assayed in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes. PreZad was cotranslationally translocated across the vesicular membranes. Unexpectedly, the signal sequence was not removed although a suitable cleavage site was preserved and presented within the vesicle lumen. Failure to cleave the signal sequence was apparently not due to the lack of a beta-turn near the processing site. When a beta-turn was introduced near the cleavage site through site-directed mutagenesis, no processing was observed. PreZad was not solubilized by alkaline treatment of the microsomes, indicating an integral membrane association. Resistance to proteolysis, in the absence of detergent, indicates that preZad is associated with the membranes in a type II orientation (C-terminus in and N-terminus outside the vesicles). Analysis of truncated versions of preZad showed that it is the uncleaved signal sequence that functions as a signal-anchor. Changing the ratio of net charge flanking the signal sequence to less than 1 (N-terminal:C-terminal) did not alter the type II membrane orientation, as would have been predicted by the 'positive-in rule'. Our results provide additional insight into the role of the passenger protein and signal sequence-flanking regions in recognition of a signal peptidase processing site, and the orientation of insertion of a signal-anchor sequence into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.","Biochim Biophys Acta","Biochimica et biophysica acta","1068","2","179-88","2025-11-04 11:51:56","2025-11-04 11:51:56"

We examine how male ornament evolution is reflected in female morphology. Lande's two-step model of the evolution of dimorphism predicts that γ (the genetic correlation between the sexes) causes trait elaboration to first evolve quickly in both sexes, then dimorphism evolves more slowly. On the hummingbird phylogeny, tail length does not fit this two-step model; although hummingbirds repeatedly evolved ornamental, elongated tails, dimorphism evolves on the same phylogenetic branch as elongation, implying that γ quickly evolves to be low over phylogenetic timescales. Male ""bee"" hummingbirds have evolved diverse rectrix shapes that they use to produce sound. Female morphologies exhibit subtle, pervasive correlations with male morphology. No female-adaptive hypotheses explain these correlations, since females do not also make sounds with their tail. Subtle shape similarity has arisen through the genetic correlation with males, and is subject to intralocus sexual conflict. Intralocus sexual conflict may produce increased phenotypic variation of female ornaments. Other evolutionary constraints on tail morphology include a developmental correlation between neighboring tail-feathers, biasing tail elaboration to occur most often at the ends of the feather tract (rectrix 5 or 1) and not the middle.","Evolution","Evolution; international journal of organic evolution","74","3","528-543","2025-11-04 11:51:57","2025-11-04 11:51:57"

These increases were dose-dependent and depended on the time of exposure and the time incubated postexposure. The patterns of the increase in mitotic index and AFP production after cessation of carcinogen exposure were very similar, with the increase in mitotic index occurring slightly before that for the AFP production and it is suggested from this and other data that the production of AFP is dependent on the generation of a cell species functionally distinct from the non-dividing hepatocytes.

Its role in cancer, though significant, is less well understood. We show that REST downregulation in weakly invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells converts them to a more invasive phenotype, while REST overexpression in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells suppresses invasiveness. Surprisingly, the mechanism responsible for these phenotypic changes does not depend directly on the transcriptional function of REST protein. Instead, it is driven by previously unstudied mid-size (30-200 nt) non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) derived from the first exon of an alternatively spliced REST transcript: REST-003. We show that processing of REST-003 into ncRNAs is controlled by an uncharacterized serine/arginine repeat-related protein, SRRM3. SRRM3 expression may be under REST-mediated transcriptional control, as it increases following REST downregulation. The SRRM3-dependent regulation of REST-003 processing into ncRNAs has many similarities to recently described promoter-associated small RNA-like processes. Targeting ncRNAs that control invasiveness could lead to new therapeutic approaches to limit breast cancer metastasis.","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","5","N/A","11207","2025-11-04 11:52:06","2025-11-04 11:52:06"

Here, we provide direct evidence of central tremor processing in a 76-year-old female who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermedial nucleus of the thalamus (Vim-DBS) because of neuropathic tremor associated with IgM paraproteinemia. Electrophysiological recordings of EEG and EMG were performed in three perioperative sessions: (1) preoperatively, (2) intraoperatively, and (3) 4 days after surgery in both rest and postural tremor conditions. Tremor-related synchronization (coherence) between motor cortex (M1) and muscles (M. extensor digitorum, M. flexor digitorum) was assessed, and additional intraoperative local field potential (LFP) recordings from Vim allowed comprehensive coherence mapping in thalamo-cortico-muscular networks. Directionality of information flow was determined by directed transfer function (DTF) and phase analyses. Stimulation effects on tremor and corticomuscular coherence were assessed and the patient was followed for 12 months on clinical outcome measures (Tremor Rating Scale, CADET-Score). Vim-DBS reduced tremor (59%) and improved motor functionality in daily activities (31%, CADET-A) after 12 months. Intraoperative recordings demonstrated significant coherence in the tremor frequency (4 Hz) between M1 and contralateral muscle, Vim and ipsilateral M1, Vim and contralateral muscle, but not between Vim and contralateral M1. Information flow was directed from M1 to Vim and bidirectional between M1 and muscle and between Vim and muscle, respectively.

However, less is known about the neural mechanisms by which a cognitive orientation toward meaning might also promote memory errors, with one open question being whether the HPC-a region traditionally implicated in precise memory formation-also contributes to behavioral imprecision. We used fMRI to characterize encoding-phase signatures as people oriented toward the meaning (story) versus perceptual style (artist) of storybook-style illustrations and then linked them to subsequent true and false memories. We found that story and artist orientation tasks were each associated with both unique univariate profiles and consistent neural states defined using multivoxel patterns. Linking these neural signatures to behavior, we found that greater medial pFC activation and alignment of neural patterns to the story (but not artist) state was related to subsequent memory success on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, among successfully remembered experiences, greater anterior HPC engagement at encoding was associated with a higher likelihood of related false recognitions, consistent with the encoding of broad traces in this region. Interestingly, these effects did not reliably vary by cued orientation. These results suggest that, irrespective of the cued encoding orientation, neocortical and hippocampal mechanisms associated with orienting to meaning (story) over perceptual (artist) features may support memory, with the formation of generalizable memories being a specialty of anterior HPC.","J Cogn Neurosci","Journal of cognitive neuroscience","35","11","1716-1740","2025-11-04 11:52:10","2025-11-04 11:52:10"

In the present study, rabbit lenses were exposed to constant concentrations of H2O2 (0.01 to 0.1 mM) that were maintained in culture media with the use of a peristaltic pump. The rate at which H2O2 entered the lens was proportional to its concentration in the medium and reached 2.6 mumol H2O2/lens/3 hr at 0.1 mM H2O2. Up to 0.06 mM H2O2, a concentration that approximates that present in normal rabbit aqueous humor, the activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) increased linearly with no significant decrease in the concentration of lens GSH. However, at 0.1 mM H2O2, there was indication of oxidative damage to the lens as shown by a sharp decrease in HMPS activity and a coincident drop in the concentration of GSH. Pretreatment of lenses with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), an inhibitor of glutathione reductase (GR), blocked the normal threefold stimulation of HMPS activity occurring in the presence of 0.06 mM H2O2 and resulted in accumulation of oxidized GSH. This result demonstrated the inability of H2O2 to react directly with NADPH in the lens. BCNU was shown not to affect the potential of the HMPS to respond to compounds other than H2O2 since it did not alter methylene blue-stimulation of HMPS activity. The study supports the hypothesis that detoxification of H2O2 in the aqueous humor is linked to the metabolism of GSH in the lens and demonstrates that lenses with impaired GR activity are more susceptible to oxidative damage by peroxide.","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","Investigative ophthalmology & visual science","24","1","113-8","2025-11-04 11:52:11","2025-11-04 11:52:11"

Current data suggest higher prenatal testosterone levels among bisexual and homosexual women, but are inconclusive for men. This study examined the association between sexual orientation and non-right-handedness for sex differences and whether higher rates of mixed-handedness, rather than left-handedness, might be the driving factor. This allowed for more specific tests regarding the predictions of two competing theories of prenatal androgen exposure, the Geschwind-Galaburda theory and the callosal hypothesis, than in previous research. Being a potentially better indicator of cerebral lateralization than handedness, associations with footedness were also explored. To counter inconsistencies and shortcomings of previous research, we utilized two large discovery and replication datasets (ns = 2368 and 1565) and applied latent variable analysis to reliably classify lateral preferences (i.e., handedness, footedness). This maximized the statistical conclusion validity and allowed for direct tests of replicability. Sexual orientation was differentially associated with lateral preferences among men and women. Associations among women were consistent with predictions of the Geschwind-Galaburda theory, whereas among men they were consistent with predictions of the callosal hypothesis. The results were further consistent with models of homosexuality that suggest a role of parental epigenetic marks on sexually dimorphic fetal development.

Transformation of the maize BE gene(s) in AC71 (glgB-) showed complementation in branching activity. Analysis by HPAEC revealed different structures between glycogen of E. coli B and alpha-glucan of AC71 transformed with a different maize BE gene(s).

Glycan array screening demonstrated that the carbohydrate-recognition domain of GalMBP selectively binds common groups of tumor-associated glycans, including Lewis-type structures and T antigen, suggesting that engineered glycan-binding proteins such as GalMBP represent novel tools for the characterization of glycoproteins bearing tumor-associated glycans. Blotting of cell extracts and membranes from MCF7 breast cancer cells with radiolabeled GalMBP was used to demonstrate that it binds to a selected set of high molecular weight glycoproteins that could be purified from MCF7 cells on an affinity column constructed with GalMBP. Proteomic and glycomic analysis of these glycoproteins by mass spectrometry showed that they are forms of CD98hc that bear glycans displaying heavily fucosylated termini, including Lewis(x) and Lewis(y) structures. The pool of ligands was found to include the target ligands for anti-CD15 antibodies, which are commonly used to detect Lewis(x) antigen on tumors, and for the endothelial scavenger receptor C-type lectin, which may be involved in tumor metastasis through interactions with this antigen. A survey of additional breast cancer cell lines reveals that there is wide variation in the types of glycosylation that lead to binding of GalMBP. Higher levels of binding are associated either with the presence of outer-arm fucosylated structures carried on a variety of different cell surface glycoproteins or with the presence of high levels of the mucin MUC1 bearing T antigen.","Glycobiology","Glycobiology","19","8","899-909","2025-11-04 11:52:17","2025-11-04 11:52:17"

However, the effects of t10,c12 CLA on hepatic lipid synthesis and the associated mechanisms are largely unknown. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that gut microbiota-producing t10,c12 CLA would induce de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) synthesis in HepG2 cells, promoting lipid accumulation. It was found that treatment with t10,c12 CLA (100 micrometer) for 72 h increased neutral lipid accumulation via enhanced incorporation of acetate, palmitate, oleate, and 2- deoxyglucose into TG. Furthermore, treatment with t10,c12 CLA led to increased mRNA expression and protein levels of lipogenic genes including SREBP1, ACC1, FASN, ELOVL6, GPAT1, and DGAT1, presenting potential mechanisms by which CLA may increase lipid deposition. Most strikingly, t10,c12 CLA treatment for 3 h increased phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K, and S6. Taken together, gut microbiota-producing t10,c12 CLA activates hepatic de novo lipogenesis and TG synthesis through activation of the mTOR/SREBP1 pathway, with consequent lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.","J Microbiol Biotechnol","Journal of microbiology and biotechnology","23","11","1569-76","2025-11-04 11:52:20","2025-11-04 11:52:20"

This study was conducted to analyze the capacity of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) to synthesize and release basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and to characterize its regulation by inflammatory cytokines. HPMCs constitutively synthesized and released considerable amounts of bFGF as detected by a specific immunoassay. Almost 80% of bFGF (1547 +/- 173 pg/10(5) cells) was localized intracellularly. Approximately 20% of the bFGF (357 +/- 27 pg/10(5) cells) was associated with extracellular matrix components on the HPMC surface. Small amounts of bFGF (<1%) were detectable in tissue culture supernatants (8.4 +/- 1.4 pg/10(5) cells). Treatment of HPMCs with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; 1 ng/ml) resulted in a significant increase in bFGF production. The intracellular bFGF content showed a rapid but only transient increase, which was significant above background levels after 24 hours (41% increase; P < 0.05). This increase in intracellular bFGF concentration was associated with an induction of the release of bFGF. Within 96 hours, the release of bFGF to the cell surface and into the supernatant increased by 58% (564 +/- 52.4 pg/10(5) cells; P < 0.01) and by 214% (26.4 +/- 3.2 pg/10(5) cells; P < 0.001), respectively. Neither tumor necrosis factor-alpha nor interferon-gamma affected bFGF synthesis by HPMCs. Stimulation of HPMCs with IL-1beta increased steady-state levels of bFGF-specific mRNA. Immunohistochemical analyses of peritoneal tissue revealed constitutive expression of bFGF by HPMCs. This in situ expression proved to be most pronounced in areas of serosal inflammation in activated HPMCs. Our study demonstrates that HPMCs synthesize and release significant amounts of bFGF and that the expression of this growth factor is significantly up-regulated by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. The data support the view that HPMCs are key regulators of abdominal disease processes such as peritonitis, peritoneal fibrosis, or peritoneal tumor metastasis.","Am J Pathol","The American journal of pathology","155","6","1977-84","2025-11-04 11:52:23","2025-11-04 11:52:23"

Whole brain voxel-based morphometry was used to detect differences in the GMV and WMV between SLE patients and HC and those between SLE patients at S1 and S2. SLE patients were found to have lower GMV than HC in the middle cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus and right supplementary motor area, and lower WMV in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum cingulate gyrus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus at both S1 and S2. Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed increased GMV chiefly in the prefrontal regions at S2 compared to S1 in SLE patients. The GMV increase in the left superior frontal gyrus was significantly associated with lowered SLE disease activity. In conclusion, GMV and WMV reduced very early in SLE patients.

In contrast, the traditional PTV-based optimization considers only setup uncertainties and adds a margin only to targets but no margins to the OARs. It also ignores range uncertainty. The purpose of this work is to determine if robustly optimized plans are superior to PTV-based plans simply because the latter do not assign margins to OARs during optimization.","Med Phys","Medical physics","40","2","021709","2025-11-04 11:52:24","2025-11-04 11:52:24"

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells are believed to be derived from neuroepithelial body cells and may represent a model system for investigating the mechanisms of airway chemoreception. Here we have used the whole cell patch-clamp technique to investigate the effects of acute hypoxia on voltage-gated ionic currents and membrane potential in H-146 SCLC cells. Step depolarizations evoked transient inward currents due to activation of Na+ and Ca2+ channels, followed by outward K+ currents. K+ currents were partially inhibited by 200 microM Cd2+ (indicative of the presence of a Ca2+-dependent component of the K+ current) and were inhibited by tetraethylammonium (TEA) in a concentration-dependent manner, although even at 100 mM TEA, a residual K+ current could be detected. Hypoxia (PO2 15-20 mmHg) caused a reversible inhibition of outward K+ currents without affecting inward currents. Inhibition by hypoxia was also observed in the presence of Cd2+. Hypoxia and TEA caused membrane depolarization in H-146 cells, and their effects appeared additive. These findings indicate that H-146 cells possess O2-sensitive, Ca2+-independent K+ channels that can influence cell membrane potential. SCLC cells may, therefore, represent a good model for investigating the mechanisms underlying O2 sensing by airway chemoreceptor cells.","Am J Physiol","The American journal of physiology","275","4","L709-16","2025-11-04 11:52:25","2025-11-04 11:52:25"

Whilst there were some similarities across organisations, the smaller organisations developed a more tailored and innovative strategy than large organisations where there were more barriers to change and a more diverse workforce.

Recent studies by others revealed that the thrombin inhibitor, CRC 220, a modified dipeptide, was transported by oatp1. The present study was designed to examine whether another modified peptide, enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was also a substrate. Transport was studied with enalapril (1 to 800 micromol/L, with [3H]enalapril) in a HeLa cell line stably transfected with oatp1-cDNA under the regulation of a Zn2+-inducible promoter. Noninduced transfected cells (without zinc) that did not express oatp1 failed to take up enalapril. In contrast, cells expressing oatp1 transported enalapril, estrone sulfate (E1S), taurolithocholic acid sulfate (TLCAS), and the glutathione conjugate of BSP (BSPGSH). Uptake of enalapril by oatp1 at 37 degreesC was substantially higher than that at 4 degreesC. The rate at 37 degreesC (uptake rates for induced - noninduced, transfected cells) was linear over 5 minutes and was concentration-dependent, characterized by a Km of 214 +/- 67 micromol/L and a Vmax of 0.51 +/- 0.15 nmol/min/mg protein. Enalapril uptake was inhibited competitively by BSP (at 1, 5, 10, and 50 micromol/L) and TCA (at 5, 25, and 100 micromol/L) with inhibition constants (Ki) of 2 and 32 micromol/L, respectively. The metabolite enalaprilat was, however, not transported by oatp1. That oatp1 is not a general transporter of anionic compounds was further shown by the lack of transport of harmol sulfate, benzoate, and hippurate. These observations attest to the role of oatp1 as a specific transporter for at least two classes of pharmacologically important peptides.","Hepatology","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","28","5","1341-6","2025-11-04 11:52:28","2025-11-04 11:52:28"

Here, we evaluate the impact of lineage-specific rates-which we define as among-branch-rate-variation that acts consistently across the entire genome. We compare its impact to residual rates-defined as among-branch-rate-variation that shows a different pattern of rate variation at each sampled locus, and gene-specific rates-defined as variation in the average rate across all branches at each sampled locus. We show that lineage-specific rates lead to erroneous divergence time estimates, regardless of how many loci are sampled. Further, we show that stronger lineage-specific rates lead to increasing error. This contrasts to residual rates and gene-specific rates, where sampling more loci significantly reduces error. If divergence times are inferred in a Bayesian framework, we highlight that error caused by lineage-specific rates significantly reduces the probability that the 95% highest posterior density includes the correct value, and leads to sensitivity to the prior. Use of a more complex rate prior-which has recently been proposed to model rate variation more accurately-does not affect these conclusions. Finally, we show that the scale of lineage-specific rates used in our simulation experiments is comparable to that of an empirical data set for the angiosperm genus Ipomoea. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that lineage-specific rates cause error in divergence time estimates, and that this error is not overcome by analyzing genomic scale multilocus data sets.

Sheepshead show a significant longitudinal shift in relaxation rate in red muscle, with anterior muscle displaying faster rates of relaxation than posterior, but this pattern was not significant in the pink and white muscle. We hypothesized that patterns of parvalbumin expression determine relaxation rate along the length of the fish. The prediction is that total parvalbumin content and the relative expression of parvalbumin isoforms will differ between the anterior and posterior red muscle, but little longitudinal variation will be observed in parvalbumin expression in white and pink muscle. We successfully employed protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with western blots to identify two parvalbumin isoforms in each muscle fiber type. SDS-PAGE and densitometry were used to determine the relative expression levels of the two parvalbumin isoforms and total parvalbumin expression. Red muscle displays a significant shift, from anterior to posterior, in the relative expression of the two isoforms, both in their relative contribution and in total parvalbumin content, but white and pink muscle did not. The red muscle of southern kingfish, Menticirrhus americanus (Pisces, F. Scianidae) showed a pattern similar to the red muscle of sheepshead.","J Exp Biol","The Journal of experimental biology","209","Pt 2","227-37","2025-11-04 11:52:32","2025-11-04 11:52:32"

Uptake of [3H]TPP+ was found to be 1) a function of extracellular K+ concentration, 2) sensitive to valinomycin, and 3) decreased by the K+ channel inhibitor, Ba2+, suggesting that the uptake of [3H]TPP+ responds to changes in membrane potential of the BAEC. Bradykinin (50 nM) produced an increase in [3H]TPP+ uptake in low K+ buffer consistent with a bradykinin-induced membrane hyperpolarization. The effect of membrane depolarization with high K+ buffer on the bradykinin-stimulated changes in cytosolic Ca2+ was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2. The results of these experiments demonstrated that both basal cytosolic Ca2+ and bradykinin-stimulated release of Ca2+ from internal stores were not affected by membrane depolarization. However, bradykinin-stimulated influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space decreased with membrane depolarization in a manner consistent with the movement of Ca2+ through a channel.","Am J Physiol","The American journal of physiology","257","3 Pt 2","H778-84","2025-11-04 11:52:34","2025-11-04 11:52:34"

The responses at different levels of the biological organization were used. We measured organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) levels in water and clams tissues. The biomarkers selected were enzymatic activities (Glutathione S-Transferase, Catalase, Acetyl-, Butyryl-cholinesterase, and Carboxylesterase) morphometry of the digestive gland, condition index and morphology of valves. In order to integrate all the responses a multivariate analysis and integrated stress index were applied. Our results showed the presence of contaminants along the studied river and the ability of C. largillierti to bioaccumulate them. All the biomarkers selected varied according to the water quality gradient, although there was no specific correlation with OCPs and PCBs levels. At the most polluted sites, the detoxification and oxidative stress enzymes, the morphometric analysis of the digestive gland and the variation in the morphology of the valves indicated the water quality degradation. The multivariate analyses allowed to discriminate the sites according to the different biomarker responses. The IBR index also showed a variation pattern according to the environmental quality gradient along the basin.

Although several transgenic mice expressing these receptors have been generated as small animal models for measles, these mice usually have to be made defective in IFN-α/β signaling to facilitate MV replication. Similarly, when functional receptors are expressed by transfection, mouse cells do not allow MV growth as efficiently as primate cells. In this study, we demonstrate that MV efficiently grows in SLAM-expressing mouse cells in which the Sendai virus (SeV) C protein is transiently expressed. We developed a SLAM-expressing mouse cell line whose genome also encodes the SeV C protein downstream of the sequence flanked with loxP sequences. When this cell line was infected with the recombinant MV expressing the Cre recombinase, the SeV C protein was readily expressed. Importantly, the Cre recombinase-encoding MV grew in this cell line much more efficiently than it did in the parental cell. The minigenome assay demonstrated that the SeV C protein does not modulate MV RNA synthesis. Analyses using the mutant proteins with the defined functional defects revealed that the IFN-antagonist function, but not the budding-accelerating function, of the SeV C protein was critical for supporting efficient MV growth in mouse cells. Our results indicate that insufficient IFN antagonism can be an important determinant of the host range of viruses, and the system described here may be useful to overcome the species barrier of other human viruses.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","108","37","15384-9","2025-11-04 11:52:37","2025-11-04 11:52:37"

We found that the level of EDN1 is higher in the tissue and blood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients showing poor response to sorafenib. In vitro experiment showed that EDN1 not only induces activation of angiogenic-promoting pathways in HCC cells but also stimulates proliferation and migration. Moreover, EDN1 is related with poor responsiveness to sorafenib by mitigating unfolded protein response (UPR), which was validated in both transcriptomic data analysis and in silico simulation. Finally, we found that endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) antagonists can enhance the efficacy of sorafenib in both HCC cells and xenograft mouse models.

We find that increased use of paid and regulated care settings, such as center care and Head Start, is associated with higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. Among children from single-mother households, the probability of obesity increases by 15 percentage point with an increase in intake of soft drinks from four to six times a week to daily consumption and by 25 percentage point with an increase in intake of fast food from one to three times a week to four to six times a week. Among children from two-parent households, eating vegetables one additional time a day is associated with 10 percentage point decreased probability of obesity, while one additional drink of juice a day is associated with 10 percentage point increased probability of obesity. Second, variation across care types could be manifested through differences in the structure of the physical environment not captured by differences in food intake alone. This type of effect is found to be marginal and is statistically significant among children from two-parent households only.

The high voltage current used a 40-microseconds monophasic waveform, and the low voltage current used a 300-microseconds biphasic waveform. Both currents used a pulse rate of 50 pps. Both HVPGS and LVNMS were administered to one muscle group, either knee extensors or plantar flexors, of 24 healthy subjects. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to assess peak torque. The perceived discomfort experienced with each type of electrical stimulation was quantified by the use of a visual analog scale. For all dependent measures, data first were analyzed for the whole treatment group and then analyzed for each subgroup. Correlated t tests for the whole group and the plantar flexor muscle subgroup demonstrated that HVPGS produced a significantly greater average peak force of muscle contraction than LVNMS and HVPGS was perceived to be significantly less uncomfortable than LVNMS. No significant differences were found between treatments in the knee extensor muscle subgroup for these dependent variables. Chi-square analysis revealed a subject preference for HVPGS in the whole group and in both subgroups.

The healthy region of a frog sartorius muscle EMOC preparation continues to accumulate labelled K+ to a level higher than that in the Ringer solution and to exclude labelled Na+ to a level below that in the Ringer solution, much as a normal uncut muscle does in its normal environment. The differences were reduced by inclusion of ouabain in the medium. 3. The diffusion coefficient of Na+ in the normal muscle cytoplasm at 25 degrees C was measured using two methods. The average diffusion coefficient measured was 2.07 X 10(-6) cm2/sec, roughly 1/6 that of the diffusion coefficient of Na+ in a 0.1 N-NaCl solution. 4. The data obtained are discussed in terms of the association-induction hypothesis. In this theory asymmetrical solute distribution, basically an expression of a non-energy consuming metastable equilibrium state, is the result of specific combinations of two opposing mechanisms: adsorption which raises the level of the intracellular solute; and exclusion from cell water which tends to lower it.","J Physiol","The Journal of physiology","280","N/A","105-23","2025-11-04 11:52:48","2025-11-04 11:52:48"

In this study, we report the preparation of reduction-responsive methoxypolyethylene glycol-block-(poly(l-lysine)-co-poly(l-tyrosine)) (mPEG-b-(PLL-co-PLY)) nanoparticles (NPs) exhibiting sizes smaller than 100 nm and high drug loading content (DLC) of doxorubicin (DOX) by selecting the Lys and Tyr residues as the polypeptide building blocks. The disulfide-cross-linked mPEG-b-(PLL-co-PLY) assemblies with sizes can be tuned by varying the polypeptide composition followed by subsequent disulfide-cross-linking. Cytotoxicity assays showed that the Dox-loaded NPs exhibited efficient cell internalization and proliferation inhibition toward cancer cells, whereas the copolymers exhibited low hemolysis to human red blood cells and excellent biocompatibility to both normal and cancer cells. The enhanced internalization and cytotoxicity of DOX-NPs can be possible due to their small size and their reduction-responsive property. Anticancer studies using C57BL/6 mice bearing LLC tumor model showed that the DOX-loaded NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice without obvious body weight loss and damage to major organs.

After CFU-Es, cells are morphologically recognizable and generally termed terminal erythroblasts. One of the challenges for the study of terminal erythropoiesis is the lack of experimental approaches to dissect gene functions in a chronological manner. In this protocol, we describe a unique strategy to determine gene functions in the early and late stages of terminal erythropoiesis. In this system, mouse fetal liver TER119 (mature erythroid cell marker) negative erythroblasts were purified and transduced with exogenous expression of cDNAs or small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for the genes of interest. The cells were subsequently cultured in medium containing growth factors other than erythropoietin (Epo) to maintain their progenitor stage for 12 hr while allowing the exogenous cDNAs or shRNAs to express. The cells were changed to Epo medium after 12 hr to induce cell differentiation and proliferation while the exogenous genetic materials were already expressed. This protocol facilitates analysis of gene functions in the early stage of terminal erythropoiesis. To study late stage terminal erythropoiesis, cells were immediately cultured in Epo medium after transduction. In this way, the cells were already differentiated to the late stage of terminal erythropoiesis when the transduced genetic materials were expressed. We recommend a general application of this strategy that would help understand detailed gene functions in different stages of terminal erythropoiesis.","J Vis Exp","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","N/A","91","e51894","2025-11-04 11:52:55","2025-11-04 11:52:55"

Conventional isotherm models did not adequately model the attachment of copper to the biofilm. Long term nitritation was shown to be uninhibited at influent copper concentrations between 0.13 and 0.61 mg Cu/L. Nitratation was inhibited with influent copper concentrations of 0.28-0.61 mg Cu/L. There was no statistical difference in biofilm characteristics, including biofilm thickness, mass and density, across all copper concentrations tested, however, changes in biofilm morphology were observed.

"30206499","Jonas Willmann, Andreas Rimner","2018","The expanding role of radiation therapy for thymic malignancies.","The role of radiation therapy (RT) in thymic malignancies has long been subject to considerable controversy. The main role for RT is in the setting of adjuvant therapy after surgical tumor resection, especially in advanced or incompletely resected cases. However, recent studies with larger patient numbers and cleaner study populations than previous studies have indicated a potentially clearer than previously assumed benefit after post-operative RT (PORT) even for completely resected patients with earlier stages of thymoma. In marginally resectable patients RT may be used in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink tumors and thereby potentially enable resection. In unresectable patients concurrent or sequential chemotherapy and RT can be employed as the definitive nonsurgical approach. The tendency of thymic tumors to recur in the pleural space highlights the necessity for more effective approaches to identify and treat high risk patients. Experiences in other pleural malignancies may pave the way to novel treatment modalities, for example pleural IMRT. The role of these techniques in thymic malignancies has yet to be determined and is not advisable at the current time outside of a clinical study. As the disease often takes an indolent course with excellent long-term local control (LC) and survival, late toxicities related to radiation of the mediastinum and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) have to be taken into consideration and may jeopardize the benefit patients experience from RT, especially in younger patients with a long-anticipated life expectancy. Radiation techniques, such as intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT), have substantially reduced the exposure of OARs to ionizing radiation which is expected to translate into reduced long-term toxicities. Hence, the risk-benefit ratio of RT in early stage thymoma patients may be shifted favorably.","J Thorac Dis","Journal of thoracic disease","10","Suppl 21","S2555-S2564","2025-11-04 11:52:57","2025-11-04 11:52:57"

It is a clear demonstration of the possible cytotoxic effect of antibodies. Apart from this particular situation, the role of antibodies in inducing acute or chronic allograft rejection remains controversial. Many clinical data have shown that transplant recipients capable of developing class I or class II anti-HLA antibodies experienced shorter survival periods than those who were not. This fact, in accordance with experimental data, only demonstrates that high antibody responders reject a transplant more easily than low responders. More interestingly, there is now increasing evidence that posttransplant appearance of donor-specific alloantibodies, and probably of alloreactive-induced autoantibodies, is strongly correlated with reduced graft survival rate, especially from chronic rejection. We demonstrated that donor-specific HLA antibodies can be found in more than 70% of transplanted kidneys with chronic allograft nephropathy, and that the intragraft presence of such antibodies is significantly correlated with high numbers of plasma cells on early biopsies and C4d deposits, a recognized marker of humoral rejection. It is likely that non-HLA antibodies also play a deleterious role in organ transplant outcome, particularly the heterogeneous group of anti-endothelial cells antibodies, anti-MIC antibodies, autoantibodies and some others with no recognized target. Convincing experimental data, especially using B cell and T cell deficient mice, strongly suggest that B cells and donor-specific antibodies are required for fully developed chronic allograft rejection. The role of antibodies in inducing the cascade of cytokines and growth factors leading to tissue lesions is of increasing interest since it is now possible to control B cell proliferation and antibody production.","Transplantation","Transplantation","79","3 Suppl","S14-8","2025-11-04 11:52:58","2025-11-04 11:52:58"

Bundling activity of HSP90 does not affect actin filament nucleation induced by N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex. HSP90 is co-localized with N-WASP at branching points of actin filaments produced by the Arp2/3 complex and thereby bundles branched filaments; this bundled actin structure is inhibited by blocking direct binding between HSP90 and N-WASP. Furthermore, HSP90 converts branched actin filaments on N-WASP-coated beads to filopodia-like star-shaped bundles.

Molecular weight maps of proteolytic digests of these proteins were determined by directly coupled capillary HPLC fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. From these maps, the entire amino acid sequence was confirmed, and the phosphorylated peptide was identified. The MS/MS daughter ion mass spectrum of the phosphorylated peptide provided sufficient information to determine which residue was phosphorylated. Because protein structure, including post-translational modifications, is determined on the basis of molecular weight, this method has broad application and will be useful for a variety of diverse and challenging problems in protein structure elucidation.","Anal Biochem","Analytical biochemistry","193","1","118-24","2025-11-04 11:53:07","2025-11-04 11:53:07"

The model explicitly instantiates a reciprocally connected loop of spiking neurons between a sensory-type (area MT) and an executive-type (prefrontal/parietal) cortical circuit (the source area for top-down attentional signaling). Moreover, unlike models in which neurons behave as clock-like oscillators, in our model single-cell firing is highly irregular (close to Poisson), while local field potential exhibits a population rhythm. In this ""sparsely synchronized oscillation"" regime, the model reproduces and clarifies multiple observations from behaving animals. Top-down attentional inputs have a profound effect on network oscillatory dynamics while only modestly affecting single-neuron spiking statistics. In addition, attentional synchrony modulations are highly selective: interareal neuronal coherence occurs only when there is a close match between the preferred feature of neurons, the attended feature, and the presented stimulus, a prediction that is experimentally testable. When interareal coherence was abolished, attention-induced gain modulations of sensory neurons were slightly reduced. Therefore, our model reconciles the rate and synchronization effects, and suggests that interareal coherence contributes to large-scale neuronal computation in the brain through modest enhancement of rate modulations as well as a pronounced attention-specific enhancement of neural synchrony.","J Neurosci","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","30","8","2856-70","2025-11-04 11:53:21","2025-11-04 11:53:21"

Previously, NPM-ALK had been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. As the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) is usually not expressed in ALCL, we hypothesized that activated Akt (pAkt) phosphorylates p27 resulting in increased p27 proteolysis and cell cycle progression. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of pAkt activity in ALCL decreases p27 phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in increased p27 levels and cell cycle arrest. Using immunohistochemistry, pAkt was detected in 24 (57%) of 42 ALCL tumors, including 8 (44%) of 18 ALK-positive tumors and 16 (67%) of 24 ALK-negative tumors, and was inversely correlated with p27 levels. The mean percentage of p27-positive tumor cells was 5% in the pAkt-positive group compared with 26% in the pAkt-negative group (P = .0076).

Recently, the incidence of metabolic disease has drastically increased, driven primarily by a worldwide obesity epidemic. Transgenerational inheritance remains controversial, but has been proposed to contribute to human metabolic disease risk based on a growing number of proof-of-principle studies in model organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to Mus musculus to Sus scrofa. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that heritable risk is epigenetically transmitted from parent to offspring over multiple generations in the absence of a continued exposure to the triggering stimuli. A diverse assortment of initial triggers can induce transgenerational inheritance including high-fat or high-sugar diets, low-protein diets, various toxins, and ancestral genetic variants. Although the mechanistic basis underlying the transgenerational inheritance of disease risk remains largely unknown, putative molecules mediating transmission include small RNAs, histone modifications, and DNA methylation. Due to the considerable impact of metabolic disease on human health, it is critical to better understand the role of transgenerational inheritance of metabolic disease risk to open new avenues for therapeutic intervention and improve upon the current methods for clinical diagnoses and treatment.","Semin Cell Dev Biol","Seminars in cell & developmental biology","43","N/A","131-140","2025-11-04 11:53:26","2025-11-04 11:53:26"

Here, we provide a phylogenetic analysis of RNA editing in a small plastid gene, petL, encoding subunit VI of the cytochrome b6f complex. Analyzing representatives from most major groups of seed plants, we find an unexpectedly high frequency and dynamics of RNA editing. High-frequency editing has previously been observed in plastid ndh genes, which are remarkable in that their mutational inactivation does not produce an obvious mutant phenotype. In order to test the idea that reduced functional constraints allow for more flexible evolution of RNA editing sites, we have created petL knockout plants by tobacco chloroplast transformation. We find that, in the higher plant tobacco, targeted inactivation of petL does not impair plant growth under a variety of conditions markedly contrasting the important role of petL in photosynthesis in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Together with a low number of editing sites in plastid genes that are essential to gene expression and photosynthetic activity, these data suggest that RNA editing sites may evolve more readily in those genes whose transitory loss of function can be tolerated. Accumulated evidence for this 'relative neutrality hypothesis for the evolution of plastid editing sites' is discussed.","Nucleic Acids Res","Nucleic acids research","32","12","3615-22","2025-11-04 11:53:27","2025-11-04 11:53:27"

The X-ray irradiation with 1 Gy and 5 Gy was delivered to the whole body of rats. CPT-11 at 30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively, was intravenously infused 24 h after irradiation. CPT-11 was determined by RP-HPLC in plasma. ELISA and PCR were used to analyze the protein and mRNA expression of CES1 and CYP3A1, respectively.

While the overall features of these c-rings are similar, a discrepancy in the structure and hydrogen-bonding interaction network of the H(+) sites suggests two distinct binding modes, potentially reflecting a mechanistic differentiation. Importantly, the conformation of the key glutamate side chain to which the proton binds is also altered. To investigate the nature of these differences, we use molecular dynamics simulations of both c-rings embedded in a phospholipid membrane. We observe that the structure of the c(15) ring from Spirulina platensis is unequivocally stable within the simulation time. By contrast, the proposed structure of the H(+) site in the chloroplast c(14) ring changes rapidly and consistently into that reported for the c(15) ring, indicating that the latter represents a common binding mode. To assess this hypothesis, we have remodeled the c(14) ring by molecular replacement using the published structure factors. The resulting structure provides clear evidence in support of a common binding site conformation and is also considerably improved statistically. These findings, taken together with a sequence analysis of c-subunits in the ATP synthase family, indicate that the so-called proton-locked conformation observed in the c(15) ring may be a common characteristic not only of light-driven systems such as chloroplasts and cyanobacteria but also of a selection of other bacterial species.","J Mol Biol","Journal of molecular biology","395","1","20-7","2025-11-04 11:53:30","2025-11-04 11:53:30"

The gene is composed of 6 exons and maps at 10 cM from the upper end of chromosome 1. Northern hybridization experiments indicated that the gene is strongly expressed in leaves, moderately in roots, and very weakly in flowers. Further in situ analysis of the expression in floral buds showed that the APK2a gene is expressed at pedicels, is not expressed at the floral organ primordia of wild type floral buds, but is moderately expressed in the floral organ primordia of the agamous mutant. In vitro binding assay suggest that the AGAMOUS protein binds to a sequence similar to, but different from, the known MADS-binding consensus sequences, the CArG box, located 3' downstream of the APK2a gene. These results suggest that APK2a expression is negatively regulated by the AG protein. A close homologue of the APK2a gene, named APK2b, was also isolated from the Arabidopsis cDNA library.

Here, we further investigate whether participants can accurately generate summary representations of numerical value from digit sets and explore the effect of set size on their ability to do so, by comparing psychometric functions based on a numerical averaging task in which set size varied. Steeper slopes for ten- and seven-item compared to five-item digit sets provide evidence that displays with more digits yield more reliable discrimination between larger and smaller numerical averages. Additionally, consistent with previous reports, we observed a response bias such that participants were more likely to report that the numerical average was ""greater than 5"" for larger compared to smaller sets.

The genome integration and mutation efficiencies were further improved by dynamic regulation of mutant gene expression and optimization of the integration modules. This Two-ESM method will facilitate the construction of genomic mutations of essential genes for functional genomic analysis and metabolic flux regulation in yeasts.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation (fMRIa) and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to explore this issue, focusing on whether the PPA and RSC represent scenes in terms of general categories, or as specific scenic exemplars. Subjects were scanned while viewing images drawn from 10 outdoor scene categories in two scan runs and images of 10 familiar landmarks from their home college campus in two scan runs. Analyses of multi-voxel patterns revealed that the PPA and RSC encoded both category and landmark information, with a slight advantage for landmark coding in RSC. fMRIa, on the other hand, revealed a very different picture: both PPA and RSC adapted when landmark information was repeated, but category adaptation was only observed in a small subregion of the left PPA.

Links between phenotypic variations in xenobiotic metabolism and adverse environmental response have long been sought. Metabolism of the drug S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine (SCMC) is polymorphous in the population, having a bimodal distribution of metabolites, 2.5% of the general population are thought to be nonmetabolizers. The researchers developing this data feel this implies a polymorphism in sulfoxidation of the amino acid cysteine to sulfate. While this interpretation is somewhat controversial, these metabolic differences reflected may have significant effects. Additionally, a significant number of individuals with environmental intolerance or chronic disease have impaired sulfation of phenolic xenobiotics. This impairment is demonstrated with the probe drug acetaminophen and is presumably due to starvation of the sulfotransferases for sulfate substrate. Reduced metabolism of SCMC has been found with increased frequency in individuals with several degenerative neurological and immunological conditions and drug intolerances, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and delayed food sensitivity. Impaired sulfation has been found in many of these conditions, and preliminary data suggests that it may be important in multiple chemical sensitivities and diet responsive autism. In addition, impaired sulfation may be relevant to intolerance of phenol, tyramine, and phenylic food constituents, and it may be a factor in the success of the Feingold diet. These studies indicate the need for the development of genetic and functional tests of xenobiotic metabolism as tools for further research in epidemiology and risk assessment.","Toxicology","Toxicology","111","1-3","43-65","2025-11-04 11:53:40","2025-11-04 11:53:40"

The aim of this study was to reveal the effects of social reciprocity, social anxiety, and letter fluency on communicative behaviors in adults with ASD (n = 33, aged 18-43 years, mean age = 27.88 years) and to compare these to typically developing (TD) adults (n = 35, 19-40 years, mean age = 28.03 years). We validated a model using structural equation modeling in which social reciprocity not only directly affected communicative behaviors, but also indirectly affected communicative behaviors mediated by social anxiety and verbal fluency. The results of the structural equation modeling showed that communicative behaviors patterns differed between the ASD and TD groups, as the ASD group had high goodness of fit with the hypothesis model while the TD group had low goodness of fit. These findings signify that in ASD, in addition to problems in social reciprocity, social anxiety (fear) is a risk factor for worsening communicative behaviors difficulties.","Psychiatry Res","Psychiatry research","294","N/A","113503","2025-11-04 11:53:41","2025-11-04 11:53:41"

In contrast to the mammalian immune system, the development of the amphibian immune system occurs in the open environment. Oviparity necessitates a rapid ontogeny of the immune system. X. laevis larvae become immunocompetent about 2 weeks after fertilization of the egg. During this 2-week window, larvae cannot mount an adaptive immune response to potential pathogens and presumably must depend on innate responses. In the present study, the possibility of maternal transfer of antibodies to eggs was examined. Adult female X. laevis were injected three times at weekly intervals with the hapten-carrier complex, trinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA). The sera of immunized frogs demonstrated antibody activity to BSA, TNP-BSA, and, importantly, trinitrophenylated ovalbumin (TNP-OVA) when examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactivity to TNP-OVA confirmed that antibodies were produced against TNP. The adult female frogs were induced to lay eggs by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin. Next, membrane-free extracts of the eggs were treated with protease inhibitors in order to prevent proteolysis of proteins found in the eggs. On analysis by ELISA, it was found that TNP-specific antibodies were present in the egg extracts. This demonstrated the transfer of antigen-specific antibodies from adult females to eggs in X. laevis.","Dev Comp Immunol","Developmental and comparative immunology","33","2","171-5","2025-11-04 11:53:42","2025-11-04 11:53:42"

Dex phosphate was infused iv for 4 h, starting at 1100 h (1 mg/h). Plasma concentrations of beta-lipotropin (beta LPH) and cortisol were measured every 20 min between 0900 and 1600 h, then every 2 h until midnight and at 0900 h the next day. In normal subjects and obese patients, plasma beta LPH and cortisol concentrations fell rapidly to less than 40 ng/liter and 3 micrograms/dl, respectively, at the end of Dex infusion. Subsequent values remained low through 0900 h the next day. In 7 patients with Cushing's disease, basal plasma beta LPH and cortisol concentrations declined by greater than 50% during the Dex infusion. In these patients, rapid escape from suppression occurred between 1600 and 2400 h; by 0900 h the following day, beta LPH and cortisol levels were higher than 100 ng/liter and 10 micrograms/dl, respectively. In 3 patients with adrenal tumors, beta LPH concentrations were low, and cortisol concentrations did not decline during the Dex infusion. In 1 patient with ectopic ACTH secretion, beta LPH concentrations were high and were not suppressed by the Dex infusion. We conclude that the iv infusion Dex suppression test can distinguish patients with Cushing's syndrome from normal or obese subjects and can aid in the etiological diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","61","1","116-9","2025-11-04 11:53:43","2025-11-04 11:53:43"

We present an easy-to-use theoretical test to predict the emergence of contrasting patterns in gene expression among laterally inhibiting cells. Guided by the theory, we experimentally demonstrate spontaneous checkerboard patterning in an optogenetic setup, where cell-to-cell signaling is emulated with light inputs calculated in silico from real-time gene expression measurements. The scheme successfully produces spontaneous, persistent checkerboard patterns for systems of sixteen patches, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Our research highlights how tools from dynamical systems theory may inform our understanding of patterning, and illustrates the potential of cell-in-the-loop for engineering synthetic multicellular systems.","Nat Commun","Nature communications","11","1","1355","2025-11-04 11:53:47","2025-11-04 11:53:47"

This study explored the potential for improvements in criminogenic needs through participation in a brief, structured re-entry program consistent with the principles of RNR. Four criminogenic needs were identified as having the potential to change during the course of this program: education/employment, family/marital, procriminal attitudes/orientation, and antisocial pattern. The results indicated that overall risk level significantly decreased during the course of the treatment program, as did risk level for each of these criminogenic needs. For three of these domains, the participants in the highest risk category experienced significant improvements, consistent with the risk principle of RNR.

The swim results were compared with cycle ergometry results obtained at similar times. The results indicated that exercise-induced maximal heart rates remained the same and were similar for the swim and cycle trials, approximately 184 +/- 4 beats/min. Cycling VO2 peak was not affected by pregnancy, averaging 1.94 +/- 0.11 l/min. Postpartum swim VO2 peak was similar to the cycle results; however, during pregnancy it was significantly lower than cycling VO2 peak (P less than 0.05; postpartum, 1.78 +/- 0.14 l/min; 25th wk, 1.64 +/- 0.12; 35th wk, 1.48 +/- 0.11). Hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrits were lower during pregnancy; however, changes in plasma volume (based on hematocrit and hemoglobin) were found to be significantly greater during cycling than during swimming and also greater during pregnancy for both modes of exercise. It was concluded that, unlike cycling, the VO2 peak of pregnant women during swimming is reduced. This reduction in VO2 peak was associated with a decreased peak ventilation (r = 0.864) but was not correlated to exercise-induced hemoconcentration (r = -0.29). Furthermore, pregnancy results in a greater-than-normal exercise-induced hemoconcentration, which may be related to pregnancy-induced changes in capillary dynamics.","J Appl Physiol (1985)","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","71","4","1454-9","2025-11-04 11:53:51","2025-11-04 11:53:51"

In general, children have more vigorous counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia than adults. Children with diabetes may lose their glucagon responses to a falling blood glucose but persistence of brisk catecholamine, cortisol and growth hormone responses, coupled with the insulin resistance natural to puberty, may contribute to unstable diabetes control. Despite this, there is some evidence that younger children may not experience or at least express autonomic symptoms to the same degree as do adults. Furthermore, recurrent hypoglycaemia may induce defects in the counterregulatory responses and increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Avoidance of moderate hypoglycaemia in clinical management may restore normal warning. There is research evidence to suggest that the human brain may be able to use non-glucose fuels to support its metabolism and function during hypoglycaemia but this is not yet translatable into clinical practice and care to avoid hypoglycaemia in daily life remains the patients' best protection.","Horm Res","Hormone research","45","6","285-90","2025-11-04 11:53:53","2025-11-04 11:53:53"

Seventy-eight consecutive, conventionally treated Type 1 diabetic patients (duration of diabetes 10 +/- 6 years), referred during a certain period, were reinvestigated after 1 year, and again (for assessment of metabolic control only) 22 months after the teaching and treatment programme. Initially, mean glycosylated haemoglobin was 2.6%, after one year 1.0%, and after 22 months 1.5% above the upper limit of the normal range (p less than 0.001). Hospital admissions were reduced from a mean of 10 to a median of 1 day per patient per year (p less than 0.001). The long-term quality of diabetes care achieved by the diabetes teaching and treatment programme was unrelated to intelligence quotient, diabetes duration, or diabetes-related knowledge. Patients with normal levels of glycosylated haemoglobin on follow-up (33% of all patients) had particularly good compliance rates, and significantly lower initial values of glycosylated haemoglobin than patients with glycosylated haemoglobin levels greater than or equal to 10%. The data indicate that the diabetes teaching and treatment programme resulted in a substantial long-term improvement of metabolic control and a striking reduction of hospital admissions. The study substantiates the feasibility of applying this teaching and treatment programme on a large scale to other hospitals, so as to improve the quality of diabetes care and decrease health care costs.","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","25","6","470-6","2025-11-04 11:54:00","2025-11-04 11:54:00"

Regional cerebrospinal fluid pressures were recorded and the local cerebral perfusion pressure calculated in various cerebrospinal compartments. In the 8 dogs of the balloon expansion group, the systemic arterial pressure was unmanipulated in 4, while it was kept at a constant low level (48 and 70 mm Hg) in 2 dogs and, in another 2 dogs, at a constant high level (150 and 160 mm Hg) induced by infusion of Aramine. At respiratory arrest, regional cerebral blood flow had a stereotyped pattern and was largely independent of the blood pressure level. In contrast, concomitant pressure gradients between the various cerebrospinal compartments varied markedly in the 3 animal groups, increasing with higher arterial pressure. Flow decreased by 85-100% supratentorially and by 70-100% in the upper brain stem down to the level of the upper pons, while changes in the lower brain stem were minor, on the average 25%. When intracranial pressure was raised by cisternal infusion in 4 dogs, the supratentorial blood flow pattern at respiratory arrest was approximately similar to the flow pattern in the balloon inflation group. However, blood flow decreased markedly (74-85%) also in the lower brain stem. The results constitute another argument in favour of the Cushing response in supratentorial expansion being caused by ischemia in the brain stem. The critical ischemic region seems to be located rostrally to the oblongate medulla, probably in the pons.","Acta Neurol Scand","Acta neurologica Scandinavica","71","6","453-63","2025-11-04 11:54:01","2025-11-04 11:54:01"

Currently, there are many reports on the prevalence of C. perfringens in poultry farms, while few studies on the prevalence and infection source of C. perfringens in egg hatcheries. The present study was undertaken to investigate and track C. perfringens from one breeding duck farm, one duck egg hatchery and one commercial meat duck farm along the production chain. A total of 334 isolates were obtained from 788 samples, including 316 type A strains (94.61 %), 11 type F strains (3.29 %) and seven type G strains (2.10 %). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 61.87 % of the tested isolates were multidrug-resistant. Multilocus sequence typing showed that 66 representative isolates encompassed 60 different sequence types (STs), clustered in ten clonal complexes (CCs) and 20 singletons. CC2 was the most popular CC, accounting for 58.82 % (10/17) of the strains from breeding duck farm. Some strains of duck embryos were distributed in the same ST or CC as strains from breeding duck farm and duck egg hatchery, indicating close genetic relationship between them. The study showed that isolates from breeding duck farm had formed a dominant CC through long-term evolution, some duck embryos had been infected with C. perfringens during the incubation period and the infected strains should be from the duck egg hatchery or breeding duck farm with the possibility of vertical transmission. The close relationship between strains from breeding ducks and duck embryos, the high antibiotic resistance of isolates and the presence of cpe-positive or netB-positive isolates indicated that alert should be paid to such risks associated with these.","Vet Microbiol","Veterinary microbiology","266","N/A","109356","2025-11-04 11:54:02","2025-11-04 11:54:02"

We utilized quantitative in situ hybridization (qISH) to evaluate the tumor suppressing properties of miRNA, miR-205 in a population of human tumors. We hypothesize decreased miR-205 would be associated with more aggressive tumors. Multiplexing miR-205 qISH with immunofluorescent assessment of S100/GP100 allowed us to quantitatively evaluate miR-205 expression using the AQUA method of quantitative immunofluorescence. The specificity of the assay was validated using blocking oligos and transfected cell lines as controls. Outcomes were assessed on the Yale Melanoma Discovery Cohort consisting of 105 primary melanoma specimens and validated on an independent set of 206 primary melanomas (Yale Melanoma Validation Cohort). Measurement of melanoma cell miR-205 levels shows a significantly shorter melanoma-specific survival in patients with low expression. Multivariate analysis shows miR-205 levels are significantly independent of stage, age, gender, and Breslow depth. Low levels of melanoma cell miR-205 expression as quantified by ISH show worse outcome, supporting the role of miR-205 as a tumor suppressor miRNA.

Patients with NSCLC undergoing complete resection were divided into two groups. Group 1: pathologic diagnosis determined by TBLB consisting of 335 cases, and Group 2 where TBLB was unsuccessful and exploratory thoracotomy or thoracoscopy was followed by surgical resection, consisting of 186 cases. The post-surgical recurrence-free rate and survival rate were significantly higher in Group 2 than Group 1. Recurrence-free survival rate of stage IA patients in Group 2 (93 cases) was also significantly higher than that of stage IA Group 1 patients (70 cases) (p = 0.0018). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that positive TBLB yield was an independent negative determinant of prognosis in addition to pathologic staging and other clinicopathological factors. In conclusion, post-surgical prognosis of NSCLC patients was superior if preoperative TBLB was unsuccessful. This result suggested that advanced NSCLC had a tendency to be diagnosed with TBLB, and that the TBLB procedure might negatively impact the prognosis of patients with resectable NSCLC.","Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann","Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals","12","4","330-5","2025-11-04 11:54:09","2025-11-04 11:54:09"

Successful cognitive aging is a multi-dimensional construct that lacks a consensus operationalized definition, and has been variously conceptualized in an ipsative, normative, or criterion-referenced manner. Nevertheless, there are a number of biomarkers, at the genetic and cellular level, that provide indicators of cognitive health in aging. Functional and structural neuroimaging suggest multiple pathways to successful cognitive aging, by way of brain reserve and cognitive reserve. A number of behavioral and environmental interventions, including dietary restriction, physical activity, and cognitive stimulation, are promising avenues for extending the cognitive healthspan associated with normal aging. Thus, there is a variety of recent findings providing optimism that successful cognitive aging, howsoever defined, will be attainable by more older adults in the future.","Curr Top Behav Neurosci","Current topics in behavioral neurosciences","10","N/A","35-50","2025-11-04 11:54:10","2025-11-04 11:54:10"

Additionally, such interest is also rooted on the need for effective female attractants to monitor wild population dynamics under male-only sterile fly releases. Response of wild flies and sterile males to makeshift traps (modified polyethylene terephthalate (pet) bottles) baited with fruit juice and wine vinegar dilutions with and without the addition of sugar revealed that a 50% dilution of wine vinegar or sweetened orange juice were more attractive than the standard Torula baits during the offseason (after harvest) in a peach orchard in arid irrigated valleys of San Juan Argentina. Such results suggest that volatiles from orange peel and juice are good candidates for development of Medfly attractants, and that pet bottles baited with sweetened orange juice and wine vinegar may be used by small growers and homeowners as low-cost-effective traps for Medfly control.

To improve our understanding of the process controlling leaf shape, we identified a mutant gene in rice that causes a significant decrease in the width of the leaf blade, termed narrow leaf 7 (nal7). This spontaneous mutation of nal7 occurred during the process of developing advanced back-crossed progeny derived from crosses of rice varieties with wild type leaf phenotype. While the mutation resulted in reduced leaf width, no significant morphological changes at the cellular level in leaves were observed, except in bulli-form cells. The NAL7 locus encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase, which displays sequence homology with YUCCA. Inspection of a structural model of NAL7 suggests that the mutation results in an inactive enzyme. The IAA content in the nal7 mutant was altered compared with that of wild type. The nal7 mutant overexpressing NAL7 cDNA exhibited overgrowth and abnormal morphology of the root, which was likely to be due to auxin overproduction.

The aim of this study was to better understand the historical assembly and evolution of endemic seed plant genera in the Caribbean, by first determining divergence times of endemic genera to test whether the hypothesized Greater Antilles and Aves Ridge (GAARlandia) land bridge played a role in the archipelago colonization and second by testing South America as the main colonization source as expected by the position of landmasses and recent evidence of an asymmetrical biotic interchange. We reconstructed a dated molecular phylogenetic tree for 625 seed plants including 32 Caribbean endemic genera using Bayesian inference and ten calibrations. To estimate the geographic range of the ancestors of endemic genera, we performed a model selection between a null and two complex biogeographic models that included timeframes based on geological information, dispersal probabilities, and directionality among regions. Crown ages for endemic genera ranged from Early Eocene (53.1 Ma) to Late Pliocene (3.4 Ma). Confidence intervals for divergence times (crown and/or stem ages) of 22 endemic genera occurred within the GAARlandia time frame. Contrary to expectations, the Antilles appears as the main ancestral area for endemic seed plant genera and only five genera had a South American origin. In contrast to patterns shown for vertebrates and other organisms and based on our sampling, we conclude that GAARlandia did not act as a colonization route for plants between South America and the Antilles. Further studies on Caribbean plant dispersal at the species and population levels will be required to reveal finer-scale biogeographic patterns and mechanisms.","Ecol Evol","Ecology and evolution","7","23","10158-10174","2025-11-04 11:54:18","2025-11-04 11:54:18"

To obtain data on the frequency of 2n gametes, more than 12,000 2x-4x and 4x-2x crosses were made in 1982 at Madison (USA). Diploid parents in crosses were from four populations of M. coerulea, two of M. falcata and one diploid population of cultivated M. sativa which was derived by haploidy. The tetraploid seed parent in the crosses was a male-sterile M. sativa clone and vigorous tetraploid M. sativa plants were used as pollen parents. Each of 274 diploid plants was utilized both as male and as female. Of the 548 cross combinations, 266 crosses produced variable quantities of seeds which were sown in 1983 in a greenhouse at Perugia (Italy); the plants were subsequently space transplanted in the field in 1984. The identification of ploidy level of these genotypes was made on the basis of morphological characters, plant fertility, pollen stainability and chromosome counts.Of the 515 plants analyzed, the majority behaved as normal tetraploids indicating that many diploid plants produced 2n gametes. Diplogynous and diplandrous gamete production was not correlated with each other, which indicated a different genetic control of 2n sporogenesis in the 2 sexes. Only 4 F1 triploid plants confirmed the presence of a very effective triploid block in alfalfa. In consequence, bilateral sexual polyploidization is a more likely alternative for the origin of tetraploid alfalfa than triploid bridges. The present study showed that it is possible to efficiently identify genotypes able to produce high frequencies of 2n gametes within natural populations of diploids Medicago that are useful in alfalfa breeding.","Theor Appl Genet","TAG.

The absorption spectrum in the visible region of the ghost suspensions was typical of hemichromes. The spectrum was similar to that of denatured hemoglobin repared by treatment of oxyhemoglobin S with mechanical shaking or heat. Similar treatment of cells containing only normal hemoglobin (Hb AA) showed a very small amount of denatured hemoglobin, approximately one-fifth of the amount in Hb SS cells. The amount of denatured hemoglobin determined after solution of membrane with 2.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate was 0.158+/-0.070% (1 SD) of the total cellular heme in Hb SS patients. In controls, the amount was 0.030+/-0.016%. Persons with Hb AA and reticulocytosis did not have an elevated amount of membrane-associated heme. In patients with hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, denatured stromal hemoglobin was normal or slightly elevated before and after splenectomy. The increased amount of denatured hemoglobin in Hb SS red cells may be related to the instability of sickle oxyhemoglobin.","J Clin Invest","The Journal of clinical investigation","59","4","633-40","2025-11-04 11:54:24","2025-11-04 11:54:24"

Previous studies have demonstrated that TGF-beta s both inhibit and, under specialized conditions, induce the differentiation of myoblasts. TGF-beta have been shown to be secreted by mouse C2C12 myoblast cultures undergoing differentiation. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have also been shown to be secreted by myoblasts and to induce myogenesis. This study characterizes the effect of IGF treatment on the expression and secretion of TGF-beta s in the IGF-sensitive L6A1 myoblast line. IGF downregulated the expression of TGF-beta 3 in a concentration-dependent manner at 24 and 48 hours; TGF-beta 1 was not sensitive to IGF treatment at 24 hours but was downregulated by IGFs at 48 hours. This downregulation was mediated by the type 1 IGF receptor and modulated by IGF binding proteins secreted by the myoblasts. Some reexpression of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 3 mRNAs was observed after extensive morphological differentiation had occurred. These results support the hypothesis that IGFs act through the IGF type I receptor as part of a concerted mechanism to modulate expression of the TGF-beta genes, as part of a coordinated set of changes associated with terminal myogenic differentiation.","J Cell Physiol","Journal of cellular physiology","164","2","324-33","2025-11-04 11:54:28","2025-11-04 11:54:28"

Signaling of CD200R1 is hypothesized to attenuate osteoclastogenesis. We have investigated whether levels of soluble forms of CD200 and/or CD200R1 (sCD200, sCD200R1) are altered in volunteers undergoing 6° head down tilt bed rest to mimic conditions of microgravity known to be associated with preferential osteoclastogenesis and whether countermeasures, reported to be beneficial in attenuation of bone loss under microgravity conditions, would lead to altered sCD200 and sCD200R1 levels. Our data suggest that, as predicted, sCD200 levels fall under bed rest conditions while sCD200R1 levels rise. In subjects undergoing 30-minute per day continuous centrifugation protocols, as a countermeasure to attenuate changes which may lead to bone loss, these alterations in sCD200 and sCD200R1 levels seen under conditions of bed rest were abolished or attenuated.

The concentration of CO was up to 120 micromol mol(-1) in the compost piles of green waste, and up to 10 micromol mol(-1) in flux chambers above livestock waste windrow composts. The mean CO flux rates were approximately 20 mg CO m(-2) h(-1) for compost heaps of green waste, and varied from 30 to 100 mg CO m(-2) h(-1) for fresh dung windrows. Laboratory studies using a temperature and ventilation-controlled substrate container were performed to elucidate the origin of CO, and included hay samples of fixed moisture content at temperatures between 5 and 65 degrees C, including nonsterilized as well as sterilized samples. The concentration of CO was up to 160 micromol mol(-1) in these experiments, and Arrhenius-type plot analyses resulted in activation energies of 65 kJ mol(-1) for thermochemically produced CO from the nonsterilized compost substrate. Sterilized samples showed dramatically reduced CO2 but virtually unchanged CO emissions, albeit at a slightly lower activation energy, likely a result of the high-temperature sterilization.

Targeting this pathway could result in prevention of anesthetic toxicity in the immature brain. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that exerts biological activity in the developing brain and low dose exposures have the potential to provide neuroprotection. In recent work, low concentration CO exposures limited isoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in newborn mice and modulated oxidative stress within forebrain mitochondria. Because infants and children are routinely exposed to low levels of CO during low-flow general endotracheal anesthesia, such anti-oxidant and pro-survival cellular effects are clinically relevant. Here we provide an overview of anesthesia-related CO exposure, discuss the biological activity of low concentration CO, detail the effects of CO in the brain during development, and provide evidence for CO-mediated inhibition of anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity.","Neurotoxicol Teratol","Neurotoxicology and teratology","60","N/A","50-58","2025-11-04 11:54:35","2025-11-04 11:54:35"

In particular, the hypomethylation of the human-specific family of LINE-1 retrotransposons was observed in lung cancer tissues. It is also known that the circulating DNA (cirDNA) of blood plasma and cell-surface-bound circulating DNA (csb-cirDNA) of cancer patients accumulate tumor-specific aberrantly methylated DNA fragments, which are currently considered to be valuable cancer markers. This work compares LINE-1 retrotransposon methylation patterns in cirDNA of 16 lung cancer patients before and after treatment. CirDNA was isolated from blood plasma, and csb-cirDNA fractions were obtained by successive elution with EDTA-containing phosphate buffered saline and trypsin. Concentrations of methylated LINE-1 region 1 copies (LINE-1-met) were assayed by real-time methylation-specific PCR. LINE-1 methylation levels were normalized to the concentration of LINE-1 region 2, which was independent of the methylation status (LINE-1-Ind). The concentrations of LINE-1-met and LINE-1-Ind in csb-cirDNA of lung cancer patients exhibited correlations before treatment (r = 0.54), after chemotherapy (r = 0.72), and after surgery (r = 0.83) (P < 0.05, Spearman rank test). In the total group of patients, the level of LINE-1 methylation (determined as the LINE-1-met/LINE-1-Ind ratio) was shown to increase significantly during the follow-up after chemotherapy (P < 0.05, paired t test) and after surgery compared to the level of methylation before treatment (P < 0.05, paired t test). The revealed association between the level of LINE-1 methylation and the effect of antitumor therapy was more pronounced in squamous cell lung cancer than in adenocarcinoma (P < 0.05 and P > 0.05, respectively). These results suggest a need for the further investigation of dynamic changes in levels of LINE-1 methylation depending on the antitumor therapy.","Mol Biol (Mosk)","Molekuliarnaia biologiia","51","4","622-628","2025-11-04 11:54:37","2025-11-04 11:54:37"

The development and use of computerised systems must be controlled through compliance with standards and procedures for information security, enforced through national legislation and professional codes of conduct, if serious abuse of the data is to be avoided. Health care professionals cannot be expected to acquire working knowledge of how information systems are made secure since this is a technical and highly complex subject. However, it is essential that health care professionals understand why it is important to maintain a secure environment for the records they keep about patients and their care and how this can be organised. This is best achieved through a well structured educational programme involving all trainee and qualified health care staff, a task which should be coordinated by the national professional bodies. A management structure is needed within health care facilities that recognises the responsibility of health care professionals to keep the health care data relating to their patients secure. An arrangement is proposed that gives the most senior clinician in a health care facility the ultimate responsibility for security of health care data held in the organisation. Where appropriate, this would be delegated to a senior clinician with training and experience in information systems and their security. This 'information doctor' would, with the assistance of computer experts and health care managers, implement and monitor the organisation's information security strategy.

These clusters are found to be thermodynamically stable with freely rotatable COT rings, and their total magnetic moments (MMs) increase linearly along with the number of Eu atoms. Each Eu atom contributes about 7 mu(B) to the cluster. Meanwhile, the internal COT rings have little MM contribution while the external COT rings have about 1 mu(B) MM aligned in opposite direction to that of the Eu atoms. The total MM of the Eu(n)COT(n+1) clusters can thus be generalized as 7n - 2 mu(B) where n is the number of Eu atoms. Besides, the ground states of these clusters are ferromagnetic and energetically competitive with the antiferromagnetic states, meaning that their spin states are very unstable, especially for larger clusters. More importantly, we uncover an interesting bonding characteristic of these clusters in which the interior ionic structure is capped by two hybrid covalent-ionic terminals. We suggest that such a characteristic makes the Eu(n)COT(n+1) clusters extremely stable. Finally, we reveal that for the positively charged clusters, the hybrid covalent-ionic terminals will tip further toward the interior part of the clusters to form deeper covalent-ionic caps. In contrast, the negatively charged clusters turn to pure ionic structures.","ACS Nano","ACS nano","3","9","2515-22","2025-11-04 11:54:45","2025-11-04 11:54:45"

Detection using either 1D or 2D 13C NMR experiments produces highly resolved spectra with improved sensitivity. Experiments to identify and compare amino acids and related metabolites in normal human urine and serum samples as well as in urine from patients with the inborn errors of metabolism tyrosinemia type II, argininosuccinic aciduria, homocystinuria, and phenylketonuria demonstrate the method. The use of metabolite derivatization and 13C NMR spectroscopy produces data suitable for metabolite profiling analysis of biofluids on a time scale that allows routine use.

This is associated with approximately 50% reduction in median survival. The pathogenetic mechanism has been variously suggested to result from the following: 1) energy imbalance; 2) disuse atrophy; 3) tissue hypoxia from arterial hypoxaemia; 4) systemic inflammation; and 5) anabolic hormonal insufficiency. Genetic polymorphisms implicate inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-1beta, but IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha do not show polymorphisms in these patients. Early reports of elevated TNF-alpha levels suggested a role for inflammation, but recent studies have not shown elevated levels of either IL-6 or TNF-alpha. Therapeutic trials of nutritional support, hormonal supplementation, anti-TNF-alpha immunotherapy, ghrelin and antioxidants have been conducted, but only a few have shown any benefits in muscle structure and function. Considerably more mechanistic knowledge is needed before therapeutic recommendations can be made. At this time, it is not possible to attribute cachexia in COPD unequivocally to inflammation or any other cause, and much more research is needed. To date, studies have been predominantly cross-sectional, with measurements made only after cachexia has developed. Future research should target prospective observation, studying patients as cachexia progresses, since once cachexia is established, inflammatory cytokine levels may not be abnormal.","Eur Respir J","The European respiratory journal","31","3","492-501","2025-11-04 11:54:52","2025-11-04 11:54:52"

Finally, I will offer some general reflections on how the Church can regain her influence in this area-especially with the goal in mind of building a culture of life in American society-and how Catholic scholars in particular can contribute to this effort by following the lead of the late Pope John Paul II's 1995 encyclical on bioethics, Evangelium vitae, whose twentieth anniversary is fast approaching.","Linacre Q","The Linacre quarterly","78","4","415-436","2025-11-04 11:54:58","2025-11-04 11:54:58"

When interpreting the data, abortion and mental health proponents are inclined to emphasize risks associated with abortion, whereas abortion and mental health minimalists emphasize pre-existing risk factors as the primary explanation for the correlations with more negative outcomes. Still, both sides agree that (a) abortion is consistently associated with elevated rates of mental illness compared to women without a history of abortion; (b) the abortion experience directly contributes to mental health problems for at least some women; (c) there are risk factors, such as pre-existing mental illness, that identify women at greatest risk of mental health problems after an abortion; and (d) it is impossible to conduct research in this field in a manner that can definitively identify the extent to which any mental illnesses following abortion can be reliably attributed to abortion in and of itself. The areas of disagreement, which are more nuanced, are addressed at length. Obstacles in the way of research and further consensus include (a) multiple pathways for abortion and mental health risks, (b) concurrent positive and negative reactions, (c) indeterminate time frames and degrees of reactions, (d) poorly defined terms, (e) multiple factors of causation, and (f) inherent preconceptions based on ideology and disproportionate exposure to different types of women. Recommendations for collaboration include (a) mixed research teams, (b) co-design of national longitudinal prospective studies accessible to any researcher, (c) better adherence to data sharing and re-analysis standards, and (d) attention to a broader list of research questions.","SAGE Open Med","SAGE open medicine","6","N/A","2050312118807624","2025-11-04 11:54:58","2025-11-04 11:54:58"

Substantial interindividual and interlesion variability were identified in SUVmax baseline and drug sensitivity. A parametric time-to-event model identified the relative change in SUVmax at one week for the lesion with the most pronounced response as a better predictor of OS than tumor size.

Both contain intraluminal lesions of newly formed fibromyxoid connective tissue. In BOOP, the fibromyxoid lesions are susceptible to complete reversal, but in UIP they are supposed to participate in the remodeling of the interstitium. Our hypothesis was that capillarization of the intraluminal fibromyxoid lesions is more frequent in BOOP compared with UIP. In this study, we stained diagnostic thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy specimens of patients with BOOP (n = 9) and UIP (n = 10) with antibodies against human laminin, von Willebrand factor, and CD34 to reveal the microvasculature of intraluminal fibromyxoid lesions. Our results show that in BOOP there is abundant capillarization in the newly formed intraluminal fibromyxoid lesions often reminiscent of granulation tissue. The mean number of capillaries per area unit (mm2) was 107 +/- SD 74 in samples stained for laminin, 103 +/- SD 46 for von Willebrand factor, and 63 +/- SD 36 for CD34. In marked contrast, in UIP, the corresponding accounts were significantly lower, being 14 +/- SD 15 for laminin (P < .003), 11 +/- SD 14 for von Willebrand factor (P < .001) and 6 +/- SD 6 for CD34 (P < .001). The intraobserver (P < .001) and interobserver correlations (P < .002) were highly significant, showing that our results are reproducible. We conclude that the content and nature of the newly formed intraluminal connective tissue, for example, in the form of vascular growth factors, are different in BOOP and in UIP, and this partly leads to the different clinical course of these diseases.","Hum Pathol","Human pathology","30","10","1192-6","2025-11-04 11:54:59","2025-11-04 11:54:59"

Six participants were conveniently and purposively selected from a range of nursing positions including cardiac, intensive care unit, theater, and general nursing to participate in semi-structured interviews detailing their experiences. Thematic analysis of the interview data revealed that male nurses still experience gender role conflict, feelings of exclusion, and numerous other stressors working in a female-dominated occupation. Despite these challenges, participants reported that they experienced a great sense of satisfaction in their nursing careers. Further development of educational programs aimed at challenging and breaking down the perceived social stigma regarding men entering the profession may assist in recruiting more men into nursing roles.

These studies suggest no significant difference in clearance rate exists between intact IgG and its F(ab')2 fragment, and little difference between these moieties and intact IgM. Fab is cleared considerably faster than the others, however. While significant differences in clearance rates exist, the magnitude of the differences are not as large as those following intravenous injection particularly when ambulation by the animal is allowed. When ambulation is allowed, clearance rates of all classes and fragments are accelerated and quite similar. Injection into the subcutaneous tissues of the footpad results in consistently faster clearance than an injection into the subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen. Ambulation considerably increased the clearance of antibodies, presumably by increasing lymph flow. These studies imply that the choice of intact antibody versus fragments for kinetic reasons may be less critical (particularly if ambulation is allowed) by the subcutaneous as compared with the intravenous delivery route. This kinetic information should be useful in designing imaging protocols with radiolabeled antibodies administered subcutaneously for purposes of imaging disease processes involving the lymphatics.","J Nucl Med","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","28","11","1736-44","2025-11-04 11:55:03","2025-11-04 11:55:03"

Despite the antitumor activity of rituximab alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy against various subtypes of B-cell lymphomas, a significant number of patients relapse or do not respond to initial therapy, stressing the need to identify novel molecular targets. CD80 is a surface glycoprotein and a member of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules. CD80 antigen is expressed in antigen-presenting cells, normal B cells, and various subtypes of B-cell lymphomas. Moreover, CD80 is an important regulator of T-cell activation. In addition, in vitro binding of CD80 by specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) results in growth inhibition and apoptosis of normal and malignant B cells. Galiximab is a primatized MoAb targeting CD80. Preclinical studies had shown significant antitumor activity as a single agent or in combination with rituximab against various B-cell lymphoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. An initial phase I/II study with galiximab as a single agent in patients with relapsed B-cell lymphoma demonstrated its safety and antitumor activity and had provided a framework for future studies. Interestingly, and in contrast with what had been observed with other biologic agents, the time to best response for the responding patients was delayed, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action other than the traditional antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Ongoing and future studies are warranted to further evaluate the therapeutic role of galiximab in the treatment of patients with B-cell lymphomas in combination with rituximab or systemic chemotherapy.","Clin Lymphoma Myeloma","Clinical lymphoma & myeloma","8","5","277-82","2025-11-04 11:55:04","2025-11-04 11:55:04"

Unfortunately, the treatment with CSA is often limited by severe adverse effects such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Some data suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the oxidative stress play an important role in its pathogenesis, in particular the superoxide (O2 (-)) that is the most powerful free radical generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase present mainly in the kidney. The present study has been designed to investigate the role of Apocynin a selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity on cyclosporine-induced adverse effect. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of CsA, used alone or in association with Apocynin on blood pressure (BP), on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), on absoluted fluid reabsorption (Jv) in proximal tubule (PT), on O2 (-) concentration, and on nitric oxide (NO) production. We have demonstrated that CsA administration increases superoxide concentration in the aorta, decreases the NO concentration, reduces GFR and the Jv in PT, and induces a significant increase in BP. Moreover, we have shown that Apocynin treatment restores these hemodynamic alterations, as well as NO and superoxide productions. In conclusion, the reported data indicate that CsA induced nephrotoxicity and hypertension are related to NADPH oxidase activity, in fact Apocynin protects the kidney function and BP from toxic effects induced by CsA through the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity.","J Cell Biochem","Journal of cellular biochemistry","116","9","1848-56","2025-11-04 11:55:04","2025-11-04 11:55:04"

Groups of 24 ducklings were inoculated either intravenously via the vena cruralis, or intraperitoneally with pooled serum containing either 1.6 x 10(7) or 1.6 x 10(4) DHBV genomes. One control duck from each group was inoculated with an equal volume of normal duck serum. A sensitive and reproducible real-time polymerase chain reaction assay based on TaqMan technology was developed for the detection and quantitation of DHBV DNA in the serum and liver. DHBAg was observed in the hepatocytes by immunohistochemistry. Histological changes in the liver tissue were also observed. The results demonstrate that ducklings at each time point and in all groups developed detectable viraemia. In each group, DHBV DNA in the liver was at a lower level than in serum and the peak DNA titre was found in serum earlier than in the liver. In the low-dose groups it was always at a lower level than in the high-dose groups. The DHBV replication levels appeared to be directly related to the number of DHBAg-positive hepatocytes. The variation trends of DHBAg-positive hepatocytes were similar in the high-dose groups. Histological changes were associated with liver viral DNA levels. We suggest that this dose and route of inoculation can be used as a model to study acute DHBV infections.","Avian Pathol","Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A","38","2","129-34","2025-11-04 11:55:05","2025-11-04 11:55:05"

The flow in the pump was assumed as unsteady and turbulent, and blood was treated as a Newtonian fluid. At the impeller rotating speed of 2000 rpm and flow rate of 5 L/min, the pump produces a pressure head of 113.5 mm Hg according to the simulation. It was found that the double volute of the pump has caused symmetrical pressure distribution in the volute passages and subsequently caused symmetrical flow patterns in the blade channels. Due to the tangentially increasing pressure in the volute passages, the flow through the blade channels initially increases at the low-pressure region and then decreases due to the increased pressure. The reverse flow and vortices have been identified in the impeller blade channels. The high shear stress of the flow in the pump mainly occurred at the inlet and outlet of the blade channels, the beginning of the volute passages and the regions around the tips of the cutwater and splitter plate. Higher shear stress is obtained when the tips of the cutwater and splitter plate are located at the impeller blade trailing edges than when they are located at the middle of the impeller blade channel. It was found that the blood damage index assessed based on the blood corpuscle path tracing of the present pump was about 0.94%, which has the same order of magnitude as those of the clinical centrifugal pumps reported in the literature.","Artif Organs","Artificial organs","34","2","98-104","2025-11-04 11:55:07","2025-11-04 11:55:07"

We examined local nerve blood flow proximal and distal to sciatic nerve transection in rats with long-term (8 month) experimental streptozotocin diabetes using laser Doppler flowmetry and microelectrode hydrogen clearance polarography. We then correlated these findings, using in vivo perfusion of an India ink preparation, by outlining the lumens of microvessels from unfixed nerve sections. There were no differences in baseline nerve blood flow between diabetic and nondiabetic uninjured nerves, and vessel number, density, and area were unaltered. After transection, there were greater rises in blood flow in proximal stumps of nondiabetic nerves than in diabetic animals associated with a higher number, density, and caliber of epineurial vessels. Hyperemia also developed in distal stumps of nondiabetic nerves but did not develop in diabetic nerves. In these stumps, diabetic rats had reduced vessel numbers and smaller mean endoneurial vessel areas. Failed or delayed upregulation of nerve blood flow after peripheral nerve injury in diabetes may create a relatively ischemic regenerative microenvironment.","Diabetes","Diabetes","51","7","2233-40","2025-11-04 11:55:18","2025-11-04 11:55:18"

APL is characterized by three distinct and unique features: i) the accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features; ii) the invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome 17 and the Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus; iii) the exquisite sensitivity of APL blasts to the differentiating action of Retinoic Acid (RA). These features have led APL to become the paradigm for therapeutic approaches utilizing differentiating agents. The last 5 years have provided crucial insights into the molecular basis of APL. RAR alpha translocates in 99% of cases to a gene located on chromosome 15 that we initially named myl and subsequently has been called PML. In a few cases, RAR alpha variably translocates to chromosome 11 where it fuses to the PLZF gene or to a newly described partner, NuMA. In addition, RAR alpha is also found translocated to chromosome 5 where it fuses to the NPM gene. The cloning of variant translocations in APL and the comparative analysis of their associated products is crucial for the understanding of the molecular etiopathogenesis of the disease. The generation of animal models, i.e., transgenic mice expressing the fusion genes, will be instrumental in determining the precise contribution of these fusion genes to leukemogenesis. In fact, mice harboring a PML/RAR alpha transgene whose expression is specifically targeted to the myeloid-promyelocytic lineage develop acute myeloid leukemia with promyelocytic features. Moreover, the functional analysis of the various fusion proteins, as well as RAR alpha partners, is revealing striking common features beneath a misleading structural heterogeneity which unravels a possible unifying molecular mechanism towards APL leukemogenesis.","J Cell Physiol","Journal of cellular physiology","173","2","288-96","2025-11-04 11:55:26","2025-11-04 11:55:26"

Scientists have done considerable research into the molecular mechanisms involved, but many mechanisms remain undiscovered. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive analysis of the whole-transcriptome resequencing derived from thyroid tissues and paired papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and showed that lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5 (LPAR5) is strongly overexpressed in thyroid carcinoma. Then, we used TPC-1 and KTC-1 to explore the effect of LPAR5 knockdown on colony formation, migration, proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of PTC cell line cells. AKT activator was used for the recovery test. Finally, we designed proteomic experiments to explore the role of LPAR5 in the AKT pathway and the EMT process. RESULTS Cell function experiments showed that LPAR5 knockdown can significantly induce apoptosis of KTC-1 and TPC-1 cells. Furthermore, LPAR5 can promote PTC metastasis and tumorigenesis by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and decreasing its cancer-promoting effect when using AKT agonist. We also found that LPAR5 can regulate the expression of EMT-related proteins, which affect invasion and migration. CONCLUSIONS In summary, downregulation of LPAR5 expression can inhibit the physiological process of PTC, and this phenomenon is related to the PI3K/AKT pathway and EMT.","Med Sci Monit","Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","26","N/A","e919820","2025-11-04 11:55:34","2025-11-04 11:55:34"

Therefore, uncovering the solute effect on grain boundary strength is very important for nanocrystalline alloys design. In this work, we have systematically studied the effects of various solutes on the strength of a Σ5 (310) grain boundary in Cu by first-principle calculations. The solute effects are closely related to the atomic radius of solutes and electronic interactions between solutes and Cu. The solute with a larger atomic radius is easier to segregate the grain boundary but causes more significant grain boundary embrittlement. The weak electronic interactions between the s- and p-block solutes and Cu play a very limited role in enhancing grain boundary strength. While the strong d-states electronic interactions between transition metallic solutes and Cu can counteract embrittlement caused by size mismatch and significantly improve the grain boundary strength. This work deepens our understanding of solute effects on grain boundary strength based on atomic size and electronic interactions.","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","10","1","16856","2025-11-04 11:55:43","2025-11-04 11:55:43"

The differences in caries prevalence between these major tooth classes were significant. Juveniles and adults presented different patterns of carious attack on tooth surfaces, occlusal surfaces being most frequently affected in juveniles, and approximal surfaces in adults. The overall caries prevalence in the mediaeval population of Whithorn was 6.4% of the teeth present, a figure similar to those published for other Scottish mediaeval groups, but lower than the caries prevalence in an English mediaeval group.","Arch Oral Biol","Archives of oral biology","42","9","601-20","2025-11-04 11:55:45","2025-11-04 11:55:45"

Stably transfected cell lines expressing either CYP11B1 (11beta-hydroxylase) or CYP11B2 (AS) were incubated with cortisol and other substrates over a range of concentrations. Both enzymes could synthesize 18-OHF from cortisol, but only AS could synthesize 18-oxoF. AS was more efficient than 11beta-hydroxylase at 18-hydroxylation. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) of AS for cortisol was estimated to be 2.6 microm. In five patients with adrenal insufficiency maintained on hydrocortisone, urinary free cortisol and cortisone levels were high; 18-oxoF was detectable in all patients and 18-OHF in three. It is likely that the 18-oxygenated steroids were synthesized from circulating cortisol, either in the zona glomerulosa or at extraadrenal sites. In eight male volunteers, dexamethasone treatment decreased urinary excretion rates of free cortisol, cortisone, 18-OHF, and 18-oxoF, confirming dependence of 18-oxygenated steroid levels on cortisol availability. In both groups, hydrocortisone administration resulted in detectable levels of 18-OHF and raised levels of 18-oxoF. There was close correlation between 18-oxoF and cortisol excretion during hydrocortisone administration in normal subjects (r = 0.86; P < 0.001). These data show, for the first time, that 18-OHF and 18-oxoF can be synthesized from circulating cortisol. The close correlation between 18-oxoF and cortisol suggests that 18-oxoF is normally produced by the action of AS using circulating cortisol as a substrate. Although 18OHF can be synthesized using circulating cortisol as substrate, our data suggest this is normally produced in the zona fasciculata by 11beta-hydroxylase from locally available cortisol.","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","89","9","4628-33","2025-11-04 11:55:49","2025-11-04 11:55:49"

A range of concentrations of hydrocortisone (10(-10) to 10(-3) mol/l) showed significant effects on erythroid burst formation, in terms of the number of colonies, on d 10 and 14 of culture. At subphysiological concentrations (10(-10) to 10(-8) mol/l), no effect was seen, but at both physiological (10(-7) mol/l) and pharmacological (10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/l) concentrations stimulation of erythroid burst formation was noted. At 10(-4) mol/l hydrocortisone inhibited erythroid colony formation and 10(-3) mol/l was uniformly lethal. In the concentration range of 10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/l hydrocortisone also appeared to increase erythroid colony size.

The importance and minimal criteria for distinction from solid (grade III) ACC are not well established. We report 11 new cases and review the literature to further define the profile of this tumor. The median age was 61 years (range: 32 to 72 y) with a male predominance (male to female ratio of 1.75:1). The most commonly involved sites were sinonasal (4/11) and submandibular (4/11). Lymph nodes were pathologically positive in 4/7 (57.1%) cases. Distant metastases to the lung (n=2) and soft tissue of the shoulder (n=1) were observed. Five of 9 patients (55.6%) died, all within 5 years with a median overall survival of 12 months. Histologically, ACC with high-grade transformation was distinguished from conventional ACC by nuclear enlargement and irregularity, higher mitotic counts, and the loss of the biphasic ductal-myoepithelial differentiation. Useful supportive criteria were prominent comedonecrosis and fibrocellular desmoplasia. The most common morphologies for the high-grade component were poorly differentiated cribriform adenocarcinoma and solid undifferentiated carcinoma. Micropapillary and squamoid patterns were occasionally present. Ki-67 and p53 labeling indices were elevated in the high-grade components, though c-kit and cyclin-D1 were not. ACC-high-grade transformation is a highly aggressive salivary gland tumor with a variety of histologic patterns. The high propensity for lymph node metastases suggests a role for neck dissection in patients with this rare tumor.","Am J Surg Pathol","The American journal of surgical pathology","31","11","1683-94","2025-11-04 11:55:52","2025-11-04 11:55:52"

In both circumstances, the observation using scanning Hall probe microscope (SHPM) displays a controlled evolution from singly quantized vortices to nonquantized ones. It is also found that the magnetic flux is immune to the flowing supercurrent. The simulations based on Ginzburg-Landau theory agree well with experimental results.

The previously described temporal dynamics of CREB phosphorylation during the maintenance of LTP showed differences between experimental models. In the present study the level of CREB phosphorylation was evaluated in organotypic hippocampal slices from young adult rats (P25-30) after long-lasting LTP was induced. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging were used to determine the ratio between non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated CREB at a single cell resolution, revealing not only the temporal dynamics but also the extent of CREB phosphorylation. The activation of CREB after LTP-induction was compared with cAMP-activation after bath application of forskolin. An increase in cAMP by forskolin resulted in a persistent, uniform increase of the phosphorylated CREB (pCREB/CREB immunofluorescence ratio) in all hippocampal principal neurons. In contrast, the induction of long-lasting LTP in CA1 was accompanied by a local increase in the pCREB/CREB ratio. Both CREB activation and LTP induction in mature cultured slices required N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. CREB phosphorylation continued to increase for 4 h during LTP maintenance. This sustained activation is in contrast to previous observations in acutely prepared slices and supports the hypothesis that CREB plays an important role during the late phases of LTP.","Neuroscience","Neuroscience","131","3","601-10","2025-11-04 11:55:55","2025-11-04 11:55:55"

We therefore investigated the role of PGD2 in the processing of odor signals in the rabbit olfactory bulb by an electrophysiological technique. Iontophoretic (-100 nA, 20 s), intra-arterial (0.0125-0.1 mg/kg) and intravenous (i.v., 0.05-0.3 mg/kg) administration of PGD2 enhanced and prolonged the responses of mitral cells to some of the olfactory stimuli tested. The extent and duration of granule cell inhibition of mitral cells were assessed by recording field potential responses in the bulb to paired lateral olfactory tract volleys. The i.v. administration of indomethacin or diclophenac, both of which are inhibitors of PG biosynthesis, resulted in prolongation of the granule cell inhibition of mitral cells without any significant change of the conditioning amplitudes. It also caused the reduction of the spike responses of mitral cells to olfactory stimuli. After treatment with indomethacin, the i.v. administration of PGD2 (1 mg/kg) rapidly reduced the duration of the granule cell inhibition of mitral cells. These results indicate that PGD2 plays a modulatory role in the mitral cell responses to odor stimuli by suppressing the inhibitory synaptic inputs from granule cells to mitral cells.","Brain Res","Brain research","378","2","216-22","2025-11-04 11:55:56","2025-11-04 11:55:56"

We questioned whether these trends have been accompanied by an improvement in surgical results, or changes in the profile of the disease among operated patients. From a total of 511 operations (499 patients), we retrospectively investigated the data from three successive periods of 10 years each: (1973-1982: 73 operations; (1983-1992): 155 operations; (1993-2002): 283 operations. Rates of surgical failure, defined as persistent hypercalcaemia at six months, have progressively declined: 6.8%, 1.3% and 0.7% respectively. There also has been a decline in the rates of permanent hypoparathyroidism or laryngeal nerve injury. However, these complications were highly influenced by the underlying pathology (surgery for single adenoma versus surgery for multiple gland disease) and by the need for concomitant thyroid surgery. Considering signs and symptoms, the frequency of kidney stones has declined from 50% to 29.7%, while the rate of patients diagnosed at routine screening has increased from 19% to 39%. The prevalence of parathyroid cancer among operated patients has successively declined from 6.8% to 1.3%, then 0% during the last period. Our data suggest that present improvement in the success rate of parathyroid surgery be partly due to improvement in preoperative localisation. Among imaging techniques, subtraction scintigraphy, based on the simultaneous recording of technetium-99m-sestamibi and iodine-123, provided the highest rate of accurate location (92.6%). Because this imaging technique depicted a majority of cases of multiple parathyroid gland disease at prospective evaluation (14 out of 15), we now use it to select appropriate cases for a focussed surgery under local anaesthesia, without the additional need for intraoperative PTH monitoring. The present good surgical results would justify surgery even for elderly or asymptomatic patients. Surgery carried out before appearance of symptoms seems beneficial. Only asymptomatic patients with a short life expectancy may be denied surgery.","Bull Acad Natl Med","Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine","187","8","1547-63; discussion 1564-5","2025-11-04 11:56:00","2025-11-04 11:56:00"

Moreover, children enrolled in FFS are significantly less likely to be either regular or frequent users of each type of therapy relative to children enrolled in managed care.

The results obtained herein, together with data published previously, imply that photomodification of dG residues is the major two-quantum reaction under the action of high-intensity UV radiation on DNA.","FEBS Lett","FEBS letters","258","2","274-6","2025-11-04 11:56:06","2025-11-04 11:56:06"

The association of peripheral neuropathy and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in Möbius sequence seems to be more than coincidence. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration for 3 months showed the effectiveness of this treatment for this patient.","Am J Med Genet","American journal of medical genetics","37","4","578-82","2025-11-04 11:56:07","2025-11-04 11:56:07"
