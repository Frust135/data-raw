37550182,"Gürsel Çalışkan, Yunus E Demiray, Oliver Stork",2023,Comparison of three common inbred mouse strains reveals substantial differences in hippocampal GABAergic interneuron populations and in vitro network oscillations.,"A major challenge in neuroscience is to pinpoint neurobiological correlates of specific cognitive and neuropsychiatric traits. At the mesoscopic level, promising candidates for establishing such connections are brain oscillations that can be robustly recorded as local field potentials with varying frequencies in the hippocampus in vivo and in vitro. Inbred mouse strains show natural variation in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (e.g. long-term potentiation), a cellular correlate of learning and memory. However, their diversity in expression of different types of hippocampal network oscillations has not been fully explored. Here, we investigated hippocampal network oscillations in three widely used inbred mouse strains: C57BL/6J (B6J), C57BL/6NCrl (B6N) and 129S2/SvPasCrl (129) with the aim to identify common oscillatory characteristics in inbred mouse strains that show aberrant emotional/cognitive behaviour (B6N and 129) and compare them to ""control"" B6J strain. First, we detected higher gamma oscillation power in the hippocampal CA3 of both B6N and 129 strains. Second, higher incidence of hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) transients was evident in these strains. Third, we observed prominent differences in the densities of distinct interneuron types and CA3 associative network activity, which are indispensable for sustainment of mesoscopic network oscillations. Together, these results add further evidence to profound physiological differences among inbred mouse strains commonly used in neuroscience research.",Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,58,6,3383-3401,2025-11-04 10:53:22,2025-11-04 10:53:22

The latest recommendations of the DNA Commission of the International Society of Forensic Genetics (ISFG) concerning the application of Y-chromosomal markers in forensic genetics were published in 2006. The aim of this report is to recapitulate, systematise and supplement existing recommendations on the forensic analysis of polymorphism of the Y chromosome with standards already implemented in practice, new capabilities linked to the development of research techniques as well as current solutions used in statistical analysis. The recommendations have been adapted specifically to aspects related to the preparation of expert opinions in the field of forensic genetics in Poland.

TEV-1 cell line was cultured and the expression of netrin-1 was detected by using indirect cellular immunofluorescence. Exponentially growing TEV-1 cells were treated by different concentrations of neogenin (0, 1, 5, 10, 50 ng/mL) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. TEV-1 cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of netrin-1 mRNA and protein in TEV-1 cells was examined by using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. It was found that immunoreactivity for netrin-1 was observed in cytoplasm of the trophoblasts. Immediately after treatment with different concentrations of neogenin for 24 h, the netrin-1 expression began to increase. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression level of netrin-1 mRNA was 37.59+/-10.25 times higher than control group when TEV-1 cells were exposed to 50 ng/mL neogenin (P<0.01), and the same tendency was seen by using Western blot. MTT results showed that proliferation of TEV-1 cells was independent of neogenin. Meanwhile, apoptosis was significantly increased to (22.15+/-6.15)% at 50 ng/mL neogenin and (6.55+/-0.25)% without neogenin (P<0.01). It is suggested that neogenin regulates proliferation and apoptosis of TEV-1 cells. And it can enhance the ability of TEV-1 cells to express netrin-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Neogenin may play an important biological role in the normal human pregnancy and contribute to the physiological pregnancy process.",J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Using green manure to replace chemical fertilizers is one of the most effective solutions. To study the effect of green manure on the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer in oilseed rape, a field experiment with maize-oilseed rape rotation was conducted. Green manure was intercropped between rows of maize and returned after the maize harvest, with no green manure intercropped as control. Different nitrogen fertilizer treatments (0, 65%, 75% and 100% N rates, respectively) were applied during the oilseed rape season. The results showed that with a 35% reduction in nitrogen application rate, the rapeseed grain yield was significantly higher with the maize intercropping with green manure returned to the field than with the maize monocropping treatment at the same nitrogen level. Under conditions of intercropping and return of green manure, compared with the full standard rate of nitrogen fertilizer treatment, a reduction in nitrogen application of 25-30% in the rape season had no significant effect on rape yield. The agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer on oilseed rape increased significantly, by 47.61-121%, with green manure incorporation. In addition, green manure incorporation significantly increased the soil organic matter content and the soil-available nitrogen content when chemical nitrogen fertilization was abandoned. Benefit analysis showed that a 25-35% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizer applied to oilseed rape crops could be achieved by intercropping green manure in the maize season before the sowing of rapeseed in the experimental area. In the long-term, this measure would increase nitrogen utility, reduce production costs, and have concomitant environmental benefits of improving the quality of cultivated land.",Plants (Basel),"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",10,12,N/A,2025-11-04 10:53:24,2025-11-04 10:53:24

Among 16 patients with CRMP-5-IgG and optic neuritis (aged 52-74 years; all smokers, 9 women), we documented coexisting retinitis in 5. None had CAR-IgG. Fifteen had subacute vision loss, swollen optic discs, and field defects. Vascular leakage was evident at and remote from the disc; 5/5 tested had abnormal electroretinograms. Nine had striking vitreous cells. Vitrectomy showed reactive lymphocytosis (4/4), predominantly CD4(+) (1/1). Most patients had multifocal neurological accompaniments. Cerebrospinal fluid contained lymphocytes (7-32), elevated protein, multiple oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands, and CRMP-5-IgG. Three patients superficially resembled Devic's disease at presentation. One autopsied patient had predominantly CD8(+) T lymphocytes infiltrating optic nerve and spinal cord. Eleven patients had confirmed small-cell carcinoma; 1 had imaging evidence of lung cancer; 3 had renal or thyroid carcinoma. Full-length CRMP-5 protein was identified in normal retina and optic nerve by Western blot analyses. Photoreceptor cells, retinal ganglion cells, and nerve fibers exhibited CRMP-5-specific immunoreactivity. In summary, CRMP-5-IgG defines a paraneoplastic ophthalmological entity of combined optic neuritis and retinitis with vitreous inflammatory cells.

2136532,"R J McCunney, W Cikins",1990,The effect of federal health policy on occupational medicine.,"All three branches of the federal government affect occupational medicine. Notable examples include: 1) the Department of Transportation ruling (1988) requiring drug testing in diverse areas of the transportation industry (executive branch); 2) the Workplace Drug Act (1988) calling for organizations to have a policy towards drug and alcohol abuse (legislative branch); and 3) the Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of drug testing in the transportation industry (1989) and that infectious diseases are a handicap in accordance with the 1973 Federal Rehabilitation Act (1987). The executive branch plays a major role in occupational medicine primarily through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which issues standards based on a rule making process; the executive branch can also affect occupational medicine indirectly, as evidenced by President Reagan's Executive Order 12291 calling for Office of Management and Budget oversight of regulatory initiatives. The legislative branch enacts laws, conducts hearings, and requests reports on the operations of federal agencies. The judicial branch addresses occupational health issues when people affected by an executive ruling want to challenge the ruling; or in the case of the Supreme Court, when deliberating an issue over which two circuit courts of appeal have come to divergent opinions. The Occupational Medicine profession can participate in the political process through awareness of proposed legislation and by responding accordingly with letters, resolutions, or testimony. Similar options exist within the executive branch by participating in the rule-making process. A representative of the Governmental Affairs Committee, through periodic visits with key Washington representatives, can keep members of the American College of Occupational Medicine informed about federal legislative and regulatory activities. In appropriate cases, the organization can then take a formal position on governmental activities that affect the speciality.",Pol J Occup Med,Polish journal of occupational medicine,3,3,241-56,2025-11-04 10:53:24,2025-11-04 10:53:24

Blood flows (mean +/- 1SD) for 7 healthy sheep were 1.54 +/- 0.71 L/min and 1.98 +/- 0.75 L/min for portal and hepatic flows, respectively. Blood flow measurement was facilitated when dye injection rates produced blood para-aminohippurate acid concentrations greater than 15 mg/L. Uniform mixing of dye with blood was confirmed in 1 sheep with 2 portal vein catheters. Surgery to place the catheters was facilitated by using a ventral para-costal approach. Blood gas analysis was useful in confirming the placement of the catheters. Useful catheter life in this experiment was 41 days, which was longer than in previous reports. Treating the catheters with an organo-silane preparation, protecting the catheters against dislodgement, and use of a belly bandage to minimize damage to the external parts of the catheter may have prolonged catheter life in this experiment.",Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,46,1,202-8,2025-11-04 10:53:26,2025-11-04 10:53:26
9382942,"T Ohno-Shosaku, S Sawada, C Yamamoto",1998,Properties of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibitory transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.,"Properties of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibitory transmission (""DSI"") in cultured rat hippocampal neurons were examined, by recording inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked by single presynaptic neurons. In about 40% of the inhibitory synapses, transient suppression of IPSCs was induced by applying a depolarizing pulse (to 0 mV, > 2 s) to the postsynaptic neuron, which was identified to be gamma-aminobutyric acid dependent (GABAergic) in some pairs, and to be glutamatergic in some other pairs. This depolarization-induced suppression of IPSCs, ""DSI"", was Ca2+ dependent, and was associated with an increase in the paired-pulse ratio. Phorbol esters had an occluding effect on DSI when applied to the bath solution, but not to the pipette solution used for the postsynaptic neuron. Application of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone had no effect on DSI. The present study demonstrates that a pair of cultured hippocampal neurons can exhibit DSI similar to that previously reported to occur in hippocampal slices; this suggests that a dissociated cell culture system can provide a useful model system for the study of DSI. Furthermore, it was found that inhibitory neurons, in addition to excitatory ones, can induce DSI, and that a process sensitive to phorbol esters, but not activation of opioid receptors, is involved in DSI.",Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,435,2,273-9,2025-11-04 10:53:28,2025-11-04 10:53:28

Ritanserin is a new compound with a high, selective, and long-lasting binding affinity for 5-HT2 receptors. A therapeutic effect of ritanserin has been reported in Parkinson's tremor and L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias but no effect was seen in essential tremor. In this double-blind comparative study with orphenadrine (150 mg daily p.o.) and placebo, ritanserin (30 mg daily p.o.) was administered to 36 schizophrenic outpatients who were being treated with neuroleptic drugs and who had parkinsonism. For a period of 3 weeks, the treatment was added to the antipsychotic therapy after a 7-day washout from previous antiparkinson medication. Psychopathology was rated weekly by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and showed no significant changes during the trial. The Mindham Rating Scale was used to assess symptoms of parkinsonism; at week 3, ritanserin was superior to orphenadrine (p less than 0.03) and to placebo (p less than 0.01). The results confirm previous observations of the therapeutic efficacy of ritanserin on neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, and support the hypothesis that serotonin influences extrapyramidal physiopathology.",Clin Neuropharmacol,Clinical neuropharmacology,13,6,500-6,2025-11-04 10:53:29,2025-11-04 10:53:29

In 137 patients, anatomic inspection and liver biopsy were performed during the acute stage of the disease. Impacted and floating bile duct stones were found in 69 (50%) and in 43 (32%) of the 137 patients, respectively. The main liver histology was necrosis of liver cells. After surgery, high serum transaminase fell rapidly with immediate recovery in 99% of the patients. In the remaining 60 patients, their signs and symptoms settled soon after initial conservative treatment and surgery was performed after an average time of 21 days. At laparotomy, impacted bile duct stones were found in 2 (3%) and liver histology revealed regeneration of liver cells. These findings suggest that marked elevation of serum transaminase in patients with acute gallstone disease might be due to an acute inflammatory liver cell injury caused by impacted bile duct stones or migrating stones, which would be transient and reversible after early resolution of the bile duct obstruction.",HPB Surg,"HPB surgery : a world journal of hepatic, pancreatic and biliary surgery",4,2,95-105; discussion 106-7,2025-11-04 10:53:29,2025-11-04 10:53:29

32648760,"Hafiz Saqib Ali, Jonathan Higham, Sam P de Visser, Richard H Henchman",2020,Comparison of Free-Energy Methods to Calculate the Barriers for the Nucleophilic Substitution of Alkyl Halides by Hydroxide.,"Calculating the free-energy barriers of liquid-phase chemical reactions with explicit solvent is a considerable challenge. Most studies use the energy and entropy of minimized single-point geometries of the reactants and transition state in implicit solvent using normal mode analysis (NMA). Explicit-solvent methods instead make use of the potential of mean force (PMF). Here, we propose a new energy-entropy (EE) method to calculate the Gibbs free energy of reactants and transition states in explicit solvent by combining quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations with multiscale cell correlation (MCC). We apply it to six nucleophilic substitution reactions of the hydroxide transfer to methyl and ethyl halides in water, where the halides are F, Cl, and Br. We compare EE-MCC Gibbs free energy barriers using two Hamiltonians, self-consistent charge density functional based tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) and B3LYP/6-31+G* density functional theory (DFT) with respective PMF values, EE-NMA values using B3LYP/6-31+G* and M06/6-31+G* DFT in implicit solvent and experimental values derived via transition state theory. The barriers using SCC-DFTB are found to agree well with the PMF and experiment and previous computational studies, being slightly higher but improving on the lower values obtained for the implicit solvent. Achieving convergence over many degrees of freedom remains a challenge for EE-MCC in explicit-solvent QM/MM systems, particularly for the more expensive B3LYP/6-31+G* and M06/6-31+G* DFT methods, but the insightful decomposition of entropy over all degrees of freedom should make EE-MCC a valuable tool for deepening the understanding of chemical reactions.",J Phys Chem B,The journal of physical chemistry.

Seven days after the implantation of tumor cells, adenovirus vectors bearing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (ADVbgal) or the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (ADVtk) were stereotactically injected into the tumor. Injection of the ADVbgal resulted in the expression of the marker gene in 11 animals. Transfer of the ADVtk was followed, 3 days later, by intraperitoneal injection of ganciclovir (GCV) for 10 days. A control group was treated with saline instead of GCV. We observed a significant regression of the tumors in the rats treated with ADVtk and GCV as compared with control animals. In four cases the tumor completely disappeared after treatment.

Here we summarize and discuss findings presented at the 2014 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (Abstracts #283, #302, #309, #274, #275, #327) that relate neoadjuvant therapeutic strategies and borderline resectable cancers.",JOP,JOP : Journal of the pancreas,15,2,91-4,2025-11-04 10:53:38,2025-11-04 10:53:38
8764203,"M D Miller, S J Hersey",1996,Differential effects of GTP gamma S on acid and pepsinogen secretion by permeable gastric glands.,"Gastric glands isolated from rabbit stomach were permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. Acid secretion by parietal cells, as measured by the accumulation of weak base, was inhibited by incubation with alpha-toxin but could be restored by addition of exogenous ATP (1 mM). The permeable glands were found to retain acid secretory responses to receptor-linked secretagogues, histamine and carbachol, as well as to intracellular mediators, forskolin and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, indicating the presence of intact, functional intracellular coupling mechanisms. Both basal and stimulated acid secretion by the permeable glands were blocked by the Mg2+ chelator, trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA; 5 mM), whereas CDTA had no effect on nonpermeabilized glands. These results are interpreted to show that alpha-toxin permeabilizes parietal cells to moderate sized molecules without causing a loss of critical intracellular components. The acid secretory responses to histamine and carbachol persisted in media containing low ( < 50 nM) levels of free Ca2+ buffered by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (0.5 mM), indicating that changes in bulk Ca2+ are not required for these responses. Inclusion of the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S; 100 microM), resulted in inhibition of spontaneous acid secretion, blocked responses to all agents tested, and inhibited stimulated acid secretion. GTP gamma S had no effect on nonpermeabilized glands. No effects on acid secretion by either permeable or nonpermeable glands were observed with GTP, guanosine diphosphate, or guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). GTP gamma S had no effect on H+ gradient formation by gastric membrane vesicles, showing that it does not inhibit the gastric H(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase directly. These results are interpreted to show that GTP gamma S interacts at a postreceptor site to inhibit or reverse a critical step in stimulus-secretion coupling in parietal cells. In contrast to the effect on parietal cells, GTP gamma S was found to stimulate pepsinogen secretion by alpha-toxin-permeabilized chief cells. The differential effects of GTP gamma S on acid and pepsinogen secretions suggest unique roles for GTP binding proteins in these two secretory processes. The use of alpha-toxin-permeabilized gastric glands should prove useful in defining the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanisms involved in both acid and pepsinogen secretions.",Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,270,6 Pt 1,G962-8,2025-11-04 10:53:39,2025-11-04 10:53:39

Time-varying covariance is conventionally estimated from short-time data segments within a window having a certain bandwidth, but it is difficult to choose an appropriate bandwidth to estimate covariance with different degrees of non-stationarity. This paper introduces a local polynomial regression (LPR) method to estimate time-varying covariance and performs an asymptotic analysis of the LPR covariance estimator to show that both the estimation bias and variance are functions of the bandwidth and there exists an optimal bandwidth to minimize the mean square error (MSE) locally. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method, namely the intersection of confidence intervals (ICI), is adopted in LPR for adaptively determining the local optimal bandwidth that minimizes the MSE. Experimental results on simulated signals show that the LPR-ICI method can achieve robust and reliable performance in estimating time-varying covariance with different degrees of variations and under different noise scenarios, making it a powerful tool to study the dynamic relationship between non-stationary biomedical signals. Further, we apply the LPR-ICI method to estimate time-varying covariance of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in a visual task for the inference of dynamic functional brain connectivity. The results show that the LPR-ICI method can effectively capture the transient connectivity patterns from fMRI.",IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst,IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,8,2,228-39,2025-11-04 10:53:41,2025-11-04 10:53:41

17691900,"Siwang Yu, Ah-Ng Kong",2007,Targeting carcinogen metabolism by dietary cancer preventive compounds.,"Prevention is one of the most important and promising strategies to control cancer. Many dietary bioactive compounds, mostly phytochemicals, have been found to decrease the risk of carcinogenesis. Modulating the metabolism and disposition pathways of carcinogens represents one of the major mechanisms by which dietary compounds prevent carcinogenesis. In the present review, the specific molecular targets of dietary compounds within carcinogen metabolism, including various enzymes and transporters and their regulatory signaling pathways, are briefly reviewed. The expression of phase I enzymes, which presumably mostly activate carcinogens, is mainly regulated by xenobiotics sensing nuclear receptors such as AhR, CAR, PXR, and RXR. On the other hand, phase II enzymes catalyze the conjugations of carcinogens and generally are transcriptionally controlled by the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathways. The Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, which regulates the expression of many detoxifying enzymes, is a major target of dietary compounds. The final excretion of carcinogens and their metabolites is mediated by phase III transporters, which share many regulatory mechanisms with phase I/II enzymes. Indeed, the expression of metabolizing enzymes and transporters is often coordinately regulated. Besides transcriptional regulation, the activities of phase I/II enzymes and phase III transporters could be directly activated or inhibited by dietary compounds. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms have profound effects on the individual response to dietary compounds. Finally, the effects of cancer prevention and the risk of carcinogenesis are determined by the network composed of known/unknown molecular targets and signaling pathways and its interaction with various xenobiotics, including carcinogens, drugs, and diet. With the rapid advances in the post genomic sciences, it could be possible to decipher this network and better predict the clinical outcomes of cancer prevention by dietary bioactive compounds.",Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,7,5,416-24,2025-11-04 10:53:48,2025-11-04 10:53:48

Among others, ERs affect cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The microRNA (miRNA) miR-142-3p has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis by regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell migration, apoptosis, and invasion. It does so via targeting molecules involved in a range of signaling pathways. We surgically collected 20 ER-positive breast cancer samples, each with matched adjacent normal breast tissue, and measured the expression of miR-142-3p via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatics methods, luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis were used to assess whether miR-142-3p could target ESR1, which encodes the estrogen receptor, in ER-positive breast cancer cells and patient samples. We also restored miRNA expression and performed cell viability, cytotoxicity, and colony formation assays. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR were used to study the expression of apoptosis and stemness markers. We found that miR-142-3p is downregulated in ER-positive breast cancers. Restoration of miR-142-3p expression in ER-positive breast cancer cells reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway and decreased both colony formation and the expression of stem cell markers. Bioinformatic analysis predicted miR-142-3p could bind to 3'-untranslated region ESR1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Consistently, we demonstrated that miR-142-3p reduced luciferase activity in ER-positive breast cancer cells, and decreased ESR1 expression in both mRNA and protein levels. The results revealed miR-142-3p and ESR1 expression correlated negatively in ER-positive breast cancer samples. The results suggest miR-142-3p acts as a tumor suppressor via multiple mechanisms. Thus, restoration of miR-142-3p expression, for example, via miRNA replacement therapy, may represent an effective strategy for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer patients.",J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,234,9,16043-16053,2025-11-04 10:53:48,2025-11-04 10:53:48

Osteoclast surface and number as well as osteoblast surface and number were significantly increased in ovariectomized rats. Tetracycline-based data were consistent with accelerated bone formation in response to ovariectomy. Active formation surface (double-labeled surface), calcification rate, and bone formation rate (tissue level, total surface referent) were all significantly elevated in the proximal tibia of ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomy also increased active formation surface and bone formation rate in the lumbar vertebra, but the vertebral calcification rate was nearly identical in control and ovariectomized rats. Osteopenia and dynamic tetracycline-based estimates of increased bone turnover in ovariectomized animals were more pronounced in the proximal tibia relative to the lumbar vertebra. Longitudinal bone growth in the proximal tibia and mineralization lag time at the tibial cortical endosteal surface were not affected by ovariectomy.

Many harmful effects of UV radiation are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species, and cellular antioxidants act to prevent the occurrence and reduce the severity of UV-induced skin disorders. Transcription factor NF-E2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2) and its cytoplasmic anchor protein Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) are central regulators of the cellular antioxidant response. In this study, we investigated the effects of UV irradiation on the activation of Nrf2 in dermal fibroblasts. We found that UVA irradiation, but not UVB, causes nuclear translocation and accumulation of Nrf2 by a factor of 6.5 as compared with unirradiated controls. The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 induced by UVA was enhanced by the photosensitizer hematoporphyrin. To evaluate the protective role of Nrf2 against UVA radiation, we examined UVA-induced apoptosis using dermal fibroblasts derived from nrf2 or keap1 gene knockout mice. Whereas disruption of nrf2 increased the number of apoptotic cells following UVA irradiation by 1.7-fold, disruption of keap1 decreased the apoptotic cell number by half as compared with wild-type controls. These findings thus demonstrate that the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway plays an important role in the protection of the skin against UVA irradiation.",J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,124,4,825-32,2025-11-04 10:53:50,2025-11-04 10:53:50

The calcium‑sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein‑coupled receptor, can increase the release of [Ca2+]i from the ER through the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R). Intracellular calcium overload has been demonstrated to cause cardiac myocyte apoptosis during I/R. However, the associations between PKC, CaSR and ER stress are not clear. The present study examined the hypothesis that activation of PKCδ by CaSR participates in ER stress‑associated apoptotic pathways within myocardial I/R. Rat hearts were subjected to 30 min of ischemia in vivo, followed by reperfusion for 120 min. GdCl3 (a CaSR activator) was used to elevate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, but the Ca2+ concentration in the ER was significantly decreased during I/R. Following exposure to GdCl3, expression levels of CaSR, glucose‑regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Caspase‑12, phosphorylated JNK and Caspase‑3 were increased, and the ratios of apoptotic myocardial cells were significantly increased. By contrast, following exposure to rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, the expression levels of these proteins and the ratio of apoptotic myocardial cells were significantly reduced. The present study also demonstrated that PKCδ translocated into the ER to induce an ER stress response and participate in the ER stress‑related apoptosis pathway. These results confirmed that CaSR activated PKCδ to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis through ER stress‑associated apoptotic pathways during I/R in vivo.",Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,44,3,1117-1126,2025-11-04 10:53:58,2025-11-04 10:53:58

Defined as measurable indicator of normal or pathological processes, biomarker evaluation has been used extensively in drug development within clinical settings to better comprehend effectiveness of treatment in ocular diseases. Biomarkers in the eye have the advantage of access to multiple ocular matrices via minimally invasive methods. Repeat sampling for biomarker assessment has enabled reproducible objective measures of disease process or biological responses to a drug treatment. This review describes the usage of biomarkers with respect to four commonly sampled ocular matrices in clinic: tears, conjunctiva, aqueous humor and vitreous.

Only a few reports have described the ultrasonographic features of bronchogenic cysts, characterizing them as nonspecific cystic masses with or without internal echogenic foci or debris. Therefore, it is hard to differentiate subcutaneous bronchogenic cysts from other subcutaneous cystic tumors ultrasonographically.We report a case of presternal subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst in an 18-year-old man with unusual ultrasonographic findings. Ultrasonography revealed a small, oval, cystic mass containing a well-circumscribed, heterogeneously hypoechoic, egg-shaped lesion in the dependent portion of the mass within the subcutaneous fat layer overlying the sternum.Surgical excision was performed, and the cystic mass was diagnosed as a bronchogenic cyst. On pathological examination, the internal, heterogeneously hypoechoic, ball-like lesion was found to be mucous material within the cyst. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a presternal subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst presenting with a ball-like lesion inside of the cyst. This unusual ultrasonographic feature can be a clue to the diagnosis of subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst.In conclusion, if an anechoic cyst containing an internal, well-circumscribed, hypoechoic ball-like lesion is seen in the presternal subcutaneous fat layer, subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cystic masses.",Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,96,5,e6054,2025-11-04 10:53:59,2025-11-04 10:53:59

Despite the enormous technical difficulties in analyzing such an ancient process, proposals have been put forward to describe the emergence and evolution of the two aaRS families. In this chapter, I critically review some of these proposals and place them along a hypothetical timeline based on other essential aspects of the origin of life.

Herein, we retrieved RNA profile and corresponding clinical data of AML patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Univariate Cox analysis was employed to identify ferroptosis-related genes significantly associated with AML prognosis. Next, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to establish a prognostic ferroptosis-related gene profile. 12 ferroptosis-related genes were screened to generate a prognostic model, which stratified patients into a low- (LR) or high-risk (HR) group. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we demonstrated that the LR patients exhibited better prognosis than HR patients. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that the prognostic model showed good predictability.

In agreement with Bader's hypothesis of H-H bonding, partitioning the atomic energy into intra-atomic and interatomic terms reveals that there is a net attractive interaction between the ortho-hydrogens in the planar biphenyl. This falsifies the classical view of steric repulsion between the hydrogens. In addition, in contrast to the traditional QTAIM energy analysis, both FOHI and IQA show that the total atomic energy of the ortho-hydrogens remains almost constant when they participate in the H-H interaction. Although, the interatomic part of atomic energy of the hydrogens plays a stabilizing role during the formation of the H-H bond, it is almost compensated by the destabilizing effects of the intra-atomic parts and consequently, the total energy of the hydrogens remains constant. The trends in the changes of intra-atomic and interatomic energy terms of ortho-hydrogens during H-H bond formation are very similar to those observed for the H2 molecule.",J Comput Chem,Journal of computational chemistry,35,26,1883-9,2025-11-04 10:54:08,2025-11-04 10:54:08

We also clarified the involvement of nitric oxide in the effect of nicorandil. Furthermore, we studied the effect of levcromakalim, another ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener, for comparison. Nicorandil and levcromakalim significantly increased the arrhythmogenic thresholds of epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, nitroprusside, a potent vasodilator (5.0 micro g/kg per min), did not exert antiarrhythmic action significantly. Both glibenclamide (non-specific ATP-sensitive K(+) channel blocker) and 5-hydroxydecanoate (mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channel blocker) inhibited the antiarrhythmic action of nicorandil. Although pretreatment with N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, did not modulate the genesis of halothane-epinephrine arrhythmias in the absence of nicorandil, it completely abolished the antiarrhythmic action of nicorandil, but not the effect of levcromakalim.

As shown previously for bovine alpha-lactalbumin, the folding process at neutral pH is not explained by a simple two-state mechanism but involves an intermediate form that has the same amount of helical structures as the native form. The transition between the intermediate and the fully denatured states is too rapid to be measured and corresponds to the helix-coil transition of the backbone. One of the differences of human alpha-lactalbumin from the bovine protein is the remarkable stability of the intermediate at neutral pH, which can be explained by differences in the primary chemical structure. Another difference is the existence at acid pH of an additional helical form, which is more helical than the native form. The transition from this to the intermediate or to the fully denatured one also is shown to resemble the helix-coil transition. The following folding scheme of human alpha-lactalbumin is proposed: formula: (see text).

Microbial fermentation is being examined as a competitive approach for bulk production of these compounds. Competition for carbon allocation between synthesis of endogenous sterols and production of the introduced sesquiterpene limits yields. Achieving balance between endogenous sterols and heterologous sesquiterpenes is therefore required to achieve economical yields. In the current study, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to produce the acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol, trans-nerolidol. Nerolidol production was first improved by enhancing the upstream mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). However, excess FPP was partially directed towards squalene by squalene synthase (Erg9p), resulting in squalene accumulation to 1% biomass; moreover, the specific growth rate declined. In order to re-direct carbon away from sterol production and towards the desired heterologous sesquiterpene, a novel protein destabilisation approach was developed for Erg9p. It was shown that Erg9p is located on endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets through a C-terminal ER-targeted transmembrane peptide. A PEST (rich in Pro, Glu/Asp, Ser, and Thr) sequence-dependent endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) mechanism was established to decrease cellular levels of Erg9p without relying on inducers, repressors or specific repressing conditions. This improved nerolidol titre by 86% to ~100mgL",Metab Eng,Metabolic engineering,39,N/A,209-219,2025-11-04 10:54:16,2025-11-04 10:54:16

Unfortunately, this process is not straightforward. First, patient-specific variations are typically large and population-based models derived or learned from many different patients are often unable to support accurate predictions for each individual patient. Moreover, time series observed for one patient at any point in time may be too short and insufficient to learn a high-quality patient-specific model just from the patient's own data. To address these problems we propose, develop and experiment with a new adaptive forecasting framework for building multivariate clinical time series models for a patient and for supporting patient-specific predictions. The framework relies on the adaptive model switching approach that at any point in time selects the most promising time series model out of the pool of many possible models, and consequently, combines advantages of the population, patient-specific and short-term individualized predictive models. We demonstrate that the adaptive model switching framework is very promising approach to support personalized time series prediction, and that it is able to outperform predictions based on pure population and patient-specific models, as well as, other patient-specific model adaptation strategies.",Proc ACM Int Conf Inf Knowl Manag,Proceedings of the ...

Despite its commercial importance, little is known about the genome structure of P. edulis. To fill in this gap in our knowledge, a genomic library was built, and now completely sequenced over 100 large-inserts. Sequencing data were assembled from long sequence reads, and structural sequence annotation resulted in the prediction of about 1,900 genes, providing data for subsequent functional analysis. The richness of repetitive elements was also evaluated. Microsyntenic regions of P. edulis common to Populus trichocarpa and Manihot esculenta, two related Malpighiales species with available fully sequenced genomes were examined. Overall, gene order was well conserved, with some disruptions of collinearity identified as rearrangements, such as inversion and translocation events. The microsynteny level observed between the P. edulis sequences and the compared genomes is surprising, given the long divergence time that separates them from the common ancestor.

Increases in gamma power within the cerebral cortex have been found during many cognitive processes such as attention, learning, memory and problem solving in both humans and animals. However, the specificity of gamma to the detailed contents of memory remains largely unknown. We investigated the relationship between learning-induced increased gamma power in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the strength of memory for acoustic frequency. Adult male rats (n=16) received three days (200 trials each) of pairing a tone (3.66 kHz) with stimulation of the nucleus basalis, which implanted a memory for acoustic frequency as assessed by associatively-induced disruption of ongoing behavior, viz., respiration. Post-training frequency generalization gradients (FGGs) revealed peaks at non-CS frequencies in 11/16 cases, likely reflecting normal variation in pre-training acoustic experiences. A stronger relationship was found between increased gamma power and the frequency with the strongest memory (peak of the difference between individual post- and pre-training FGGs) vs. behavioral responses to the CS training frequency. No such relationship was found for the theta/alpha band (4-15 Hz).

Diagnoses were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of central nervous system (CNS) tissue and one by RT-PCR of a brain virus isolate. The CNS of all cases was negative by RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for African horse sickness (AHS), equine encephalosis virus, equine herpes viruses 1 and 4, other zoonotic flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and shunivirus, and either by immunofluorescence or IHC for rabies. Gross visceral lesions were nonspecific but often mimicked those of AHS. The CNS histopathology of WNV lineage 2 cases resembled the nonsuppurative polioencephalomyelitis reported in the Northern Hemisphere lineage 1 and recent Hungarian lineage 2 cases. Occasional meningitis, focal spinal ventral horn poliomalacia, dorsal and lateral horn poliomyelitis, leucomyelitis, asymmetrical ventral motor spinal neuritis and frequent olfactory region involvement were also seen. Lineage 2 cases displayed marked variations in CNS lesion severity, type and distribution, and suggested various viral entry routes into the CNS, based on findings in experimental mice and hamsters. Lineage 1 lesions were comparable to the milder lineage 2 cases. West Nile virus IHC on CNS sections with marked lesions from all cases elicited only two antigen-positive cells in the olfactory cortex of one case. The presence in the CNS of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophage-monocytes was confirmed by cluster of differentiation (CD) 3, CD20, multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (MUM1) and macrophage (MAC) 387 IHC.",J S Afr Vet Assoc,Journal of the South African Veterinary Association,85,1,1105,2025-11-04 10:54:37,2025-11-04 10:54:37

It was found that the interaction of these drugs is additive. In addition, Stimforte inhibits infection caused by a strain of virus, which is highly resistant to acyclovir. When administered 24 hours prior to HIV-1 infection of human lymphoblastoid cells MT-4, Stimforte exhibited reliable antiretroviral activity best expressed during the early period of infection (the 3rd day). On the 6th day of observation the effect was almost completely lost. Combined use of Stimforte at a dose of 50-100 µg/ml with a subthreshold dose of retrovir (0.03 µg/ml) had a synergistic antiviral effect. Thus, Stimforte, which exhibits, on the one hand, antiviral activity against viruses of different families and, on the other hand, the immunomodulatory properties, could be promising as an etiopathogenic tool in helping to normalize both nonspecific and specific immunity. It may be used simultaneously with etiotropic antiviral chemotherapy in treatment of generalized herpes infection in patients with immunodeficiency. Furthermore, Stimforte can be used in the case of development of drug resistance in HSV, in particular, in HIV-infected patients.",Vopr Virusol,Voprosy virusologii,62,5,211-218,2025-11-04 10:54:38,2025-11-04 10:54:38

In addition, serum and tissue concentrations of zinc were analyzed. Following portacaval shunting serum vitamin A concentration decreased to 25% of the level in sham-operated controls, whereas serum zinc concentration decreased to 80%. The mean urinary excretion rate of zinc increased in shunted rats [18.7 +/- 2.1 micrograms/day (0.28 +/- 0.03 mumol/day)] compared with controls [13.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms/day (0.21 +/- 0.03 mumol/day)] (P less than 0.01). The concentration of retinol and total retinoids in liver tissue increased 2-3-fold in rats with a portacaval shunt, and the ratio of retinol to retinoids was slightly increased. The differences were reduced when the total organ content was calculated, because of the reduced liver weight in the shunted rats. The concentration of zinc in liver tissue decreased in rats with portacaval shunts [30.8 +/- 4.9 micrograms/g wet wt (0.47 +/- 0.07 mumol/g) vs. 35.6 +/- 3.7 micrograms/g wet wt (0.54 +/- 0.06 mumol/g) in controls; P less than 0.01].

Classical inhibitors were selected on the basis of their ability to inhibit L. amazonensis serine proteases, previously described. The N-tosyl-L: -phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and benzamidine (Bza) inhibitors, which are potential Leishmania proteases inhibitors, in all experimental conditions reduced the parasite viability, with regard to time dependence. On the other hand, N-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) did not significantly affect the parasite viability, as it was poor Leishmania enzymes inhibitor. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that both Bza and TPCK induced changes in the flagellar pocket region with membrane alteration, including bleb formation. However, TPCK effects were more pronounced than those of Bza in Leishmania flagellar pocket in plasma membrane, and intracellular vesicular bodies was visualized. ShPI-I proved to be a powerful inhibitor of L. amazonensis serine proteases and the parasite viability.

Therefore, here we investigated the roles of multiple conserved herbicide-binding site residues (R318, A146, Q148, M512, and V513) in M. tuberculosis AHAS through site-directed mutagenesis by characterizing the kinetic parameters and herbicide sensitivities of various point mutants. Interestingly, all mutant enzymes showed significantly altered kinetic parameters, specifically reduced affinity towards both the substrate and cofactor. Importantly, mutation of R318 led to a complete loss of AHAS activity, indicating a key role for this residue in substrate binding. Furthermore, all mutants demonstrated significant herbicide resistance against chlorimuron ethyl (CE), with several-fold higher IC50 than that of wild type AHAS. Docking analysis also indicated that binding of CE was slightly affected upon mutation of these residues. Taken together, these data suggest that the residues examined here mediate CE binding and may also be important for the catalytic activity of AHAS.

In view of our recent findings that cardiac failure caused by the basic PLA2 from Naja m. mossambica is primarily due to hyperkalemia resulting from cellular damage and possibly also from hemolysis, the cause of death due to the basic PLA2 from Naja nigricollis was re-investigated. In the anesthetized mice and rats, the PLA2 (0.3 micrograms/g, i.v.) produced a transient hypotension followed by recovery and subsequently by cardiac failure with ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia, such as P-R prolongation, tall T-wave, biphasic QRS-T complex, low voltage of QRS, A-V block, etc. Analysis of blood chemistry revealed marked increases in the plasma levels of K+, CPK, LDH, GOT, GPT, inorganic phosphate and hemoglobin (probably a mixture of hemoglobin and myoglobin). In the atrial preparation, however, no marked cardiotoxicity was observed except for a slight negative inotropic effect at 30 micrograms/ml. When 200 micrograms of the enzyme was injected into the coronary circulation in the Langendorff preparation, also no marked cardiotoxic effect was observed except for a decrease (about 40%) of coronary flow.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of these artifacts and to assess whether they can be removed by applying a scan-specific calculated attenuation correction (CAC) instead of the default measured attenuation correction (MAC). Two independent data sets were analyzed, one with large (data I) and one with small (data II) interscan displacements. After attenuation correction (CAC or MAC), data were analyzed using SPM99. Interscan displacement parameters (IDP), obtained during scan realignment, were included as additional regressors in the General Linear Model and their impact was assessed by variance statistics revealing the affected brain volume. For data I, this volume reduced dramatically from 579 to 12 cm(3) (approximately 50-fold) at P(uncorr) </= 0.001 and from 100 to 0 cm(3) at P(corr) </= 0.05 when CAC was applied instead of MAC. Surprisingly, for data II, applying CAC instead of MAC still resulted in a substantial (approximately 10-fold) reduction of the affected volume from 23 to 2 cm(3) at P(uncorr) </= 0.001. We conclude that interscan displacement-induced variance can be prevented by applying a (realigned attenuation correction scan (e.g., CAC).

We performed multivariate analysis to determine association of body iron load with liver enzymes, cardiac function, insulin resistance, and growth. Median plasma ferritin was 344 (range 40-3235) ng/mL and exceeded 1000 ng/mL in three patients (13%). In MRI, 11 patients (48%) had hepatic iron overload and 1 patient (4%) myocardial iron overload. In cardiac MRI, 8 patients (35%) had significant but subclinical decrease in ejection fraction (median z-score -1.7, range -3.1-0.14), but cardiac function did not associate with iron status. Alanine transaminase associated with transfused iron per time unit (P = .001) after the median follow-up of 4.5 years. No correlation was found between iron load and growth or insulin resistance.

Evaluation of the use of hydrophobicity coefficients for the prediction of peptide elution profiles.","The gradient elution behaviour of five synthetic decapeptide analogues has been investigated using an octadecylsilica stationary phase and trifluoroacetic acid-water-acetonitrile mobile phases. The influence of gradient time and flow-rate on the relative retentions and bandwidths of these peptides was assessed using quantitative expressions derived from linear solvent strength theory and general plate height theory. Linear relationships between logarithmic median capacity factors, log k, and the mole fraction of organic solvent modifier, phi, were observed over the experimental range of conditions used. The slopes of these plots were different for all peptides, which indicates that divergences will occur in the prediction of peptide retention times due to conformation dependent changes in hydrophobic contact area occupancy at the stationary phase surface. However, the differences in S values (tangent to the curve obtained in a plot of log k versus phi) for these peptides were not substantial enough to seriously affect the prediction of peptide retention times at one gradient slope from those observed at another. In addition, significant differences existed between experimental and theoretical peak capacity data of these peptide analogues of similar molecular weight and overall polarity, particularly at lower flow-rates or longer residence times. These results once again demonstrate that additional diffusional and interactive processes occur during the reversed-phase separation of peptides and proteins which are not yet adequately formalized by current chromatographic theory.",J Chromatogr,Journal of chromatography,438,2,197-210,2025-11-04 10:54:58,2025-11-04 10:54:58

Such variation may arise from the variation in interfacial structures induced by the subtle difference in each synthetic procedure. Here, we studied the interfacial structures of CdSe/ZnS QDs using the time-of-flight medium energy ion-scattering spectroscopy (TOF-MEIS), which offers the radial elemental distributions as well as the overall elemental compositions of QDs. The TOF-MEIS spectra provided strong evidence for the existence of an alloyed layer at the interface between CdSe and ZnS in typical CdSe/ZnS QDs. On the basis of the emission and absorption spectra of QDs sampled during the synthesis, we conclude that such interfacial alloying is caused by the dissolution of CdSe seeds during the synthesis steps. Such a dissolution mechanism is further corroborated by the observation that the ligand environment of solvent (X or L type) leads to different shapes of interfaces.",J Phys Chem Lett,The journal of physical chemistry letters,13,31,7220-7227,2025-11-04 10:55:01,2025-11-04 10:55:01

Because amebic hepatic abscesses generally do not require drainage, differentiation from pyogenic hepatic abscesses is important. We, therefore, reviewed the records of patients admitted to the UCLA Medical Center from 1968 through 1983 to compare the clinical manifestations and to access the results of treatment of pyogenic and amebic hepatic abscesses. During this 15 year period, 82 patients (42 pyogenic and 40 amebic) with hepatic abscesses were admitted. Factors which distinguished patients with pyogenic abscesses included: age greater than 50 years; jaundice; pruritus; sepsis and shock; a palpable mass; elevated bilirubin level; elevated alkaline phosphatase level, and abnormal abdominal roentgenograms. Patients with amebic abscesses of the liver were more likely to have Mexican ancestry, recently traveled to an endemic area, abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly and positive amebic serology. Hepatic scans and ultrasonography were excellent methods of detecting the presence of but not the type of hepatic abscess. Over-all, the mortality was 40 per cent for patients with pyogenic abscesses whereas all 40 of the patients with an amebic abscess survived. However, operative mortality was only 4.5 per cent for the 22 patients with pyogenic abscess who were managed with systemic antibiotics and surgical drainage.

These complexes can retain spin information over long periods of time at low temperature, suggesting possible applications in high-density information storage, quantum computing and spintronics. Notably, the success of most such applications hinges upon raising the inherent molecular spin-inversion barrier. Although recent advances have shown the viability of lanthanide-containing complexes in generating large barriers, weak or non-existent magnetic exchange coupling allows fast relaxation pathways that mitigate the full potential of these species. Here, we show that the diffuse spin of an N(2)(3-) radical bridge can lead to exceptionally strong magnetic exchange in dinuclear Ln(III) (Ln = Gd, Dy) complexes. The Gd(III) congener exhibits the strongest magnetic coupling yet observed for that ion, while incorporation of the high-anisotropy Dy(III) ion gives rise to a molecule with a record magnetic blocking temperature of 8.3 K at a sweep rate of 0.08 T s(-1).",Nat Chem,Nature chemistry,3,7,538-42,2025-11-04 10:55:04,2025-11-04 10:55:04

Although this technique is relatively inexpensive and easy to learn, there are more chances of errors while measuring the skinfold thickness by this method. Therefore, no single standard prediction formula for the determination of body fat could be fixed. The aim of our study was to use B-mode ultrasound (US) for measuring the subcutaneous fat thickness and the calipers for skinfold thickness, and then compare, correlate, and derive the prediction equations for estimation of %BF by both the techniques. Methods This cross-sectional, observational, monocentric study was conducted on 43 Indian male volunteers aged 18 to 40 years. After collecting anthropometric data (age, height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR], etc.), the skinfold thickness was measured at four standard sites (biceps, triceps, subscapular region, and suprailiac region) with skinfold caliper (SFC) and then B-mode US. The data were analyzed for distribution, and independent t-test was applied to compare the difference between two means of a %BF estimated by both the methods. The prediction equations were developed from anthropometric and skinfold thickness data obtained from both the methods, i.e., SFC and US, by applying stepwise multiple linear regression. Results It was observed that mean values of all the skinfold thicknesses along with the %BF measured by SFC were far more than those measured by US. The %BF measured by US technique (%BF US) was significantly lesser, i.e., 20.69 (SD: 3.126; p < 0.0002), than that of the SFC method (%BF SFC), i.e., 30.38 (SD: 4.634), which is 0.68 % higher.

To pursue the likelihood that these subdivisions (the dorsal cap, intergeniculate leaflet, external magnocellular lamina, internal magnocellular lamina, and parvicellular segment) correlate with the functional diversity of this complex, the present study examined the neurochemical composition of the vLGN with regard to substances that have previously proved useful in distinguishing functionally distinct subregions within nuclei (i.e., neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), leucine and methionine enkephalins, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), cytochrome oxidase (CO), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and NADPH-diaphorase). The results showed a clear differential neurochemical distribution within the nucleus. Neuropeptide Y immunoreactive perikarya were found predominantly in the intergeniculate leaflet and external magnocellular lamina, with only a few present in the internal magnocellular lamina and dorsal cap, and none observed in the parvicellular segment. NPY+ fibers, however, were present in all divisions except the parvicellular segment. The highest concentration of SP immunoreactive cells was observed in the internal magnocellular lamina, and substantial numbers also were scattered in the external magnocellular lamina and parvicellular segment. SP+ fibers were seen predominantly in the intergeniculate leaflet and the magnocellular laminae. The heaviest concentration of enkephalinergic fibers occurred in the internal magnocellular lamina and dorsal cap, but fibers were also observed in the external magnocellular lamina and intergeniculate leaflet. GABA reactivity was widespread throughout the vLGN, with the dorsal cap and external magnocellular lamina most heavily labeled, followed by the intergeniculate leaflet and the internal magnocellular lamina. Cytochrome oxidase, AChE, and NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry revealed rich reactivity within the dorsal cap, and external and internal magnocellular laminae and paler reactivity in the intergeniculate leaflet and parvicellular segment. The external magnocellular lamina was more reactive for CO and NADPH-diaphorase than AChE, while the internal magnocellular lamina showed the opposite pattern of reactivity. In addition, NADPH-diaphorase reactive cells were present in caudal intergeniculate leaflet and lateral external magnocellular lamina. These local differences in the neurochemical character of the vLGN support its parcellation into multiple subdivisions.

The present study is designed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist, rosiglitazone, on the structure and function of the peritoneum in a PD rat accompanied with peritonitis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data showed that the peritoneal membrane in the LPS-only group showed increased peritoneal thickness, vessel density, and hypercellularity compared with the PD-only group. Rosiglitazone administration significantly inhibited increase of the three indicators in PD rats with LPS treatment. In line with this, rosiglitazone improved function of the peritoneum in LPS-induced PD rats receiving rosiglitazone, which was reflected by decreased D/P urea and D/P albumin. Mechanistically, rosiglitazone-mediated improvements in the damaged structure and function of the peritoneum in PD rats with LPS treatment were associated with reduced inflammation and preserving mesothelial cell monolayer resulted from up-regulation of AQP-1 and ZO-1.

However, little is known concerning the pathways for H(2)S production from the likely substrates, cysteine and cystine. A mixed microbial culture obtained from cystine-enriched soils was used in assays (50 min, 37 degrees C) with 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 25 mumol of l-cysteine, 25 mumol of l-cystine, and 0.04 mumol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Sulfide was trapped in a center well containing zinc acetate, while pyruvate was measured by derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Sulfide and total pyruvate production were 17.6 and 17.2 nmol mg of protein min, respectively. Dithiothreitol did not alter reaction stoichiometry or the amount of H(2)S and total pyruvate, whereas N-ethylmaleimide reduced both H(2)S and total pyruvate production equally. The amount of H(2)S produced was reduced by 96% when only l-cystine was included as the substrate in the assay and by 15% with the addition of propargylglycine, a specific suicide inhibitor of cystathionine gamma-lyase. These data indicate that the substrate for the reaction was cysteine and the enzyme responsible for H(2)S and pyruvate production was cysteine desulfhydrase (EC 4.4.1.1). The enzyme had a K(m) of 1.32 mM and was inactivated by temperatures greater than 60 degrees C.

In this study, we developed a convenient liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) surrogate matrix assay for accurate urea quantitation in plasma, serum and epithelial lining fluid. Different mass spectrometer platforms and ionization modes were compared in parallel. The LC method and mass spectrometer parameters were comprehensively optimized to reduce interferences, to smooth the baseline and to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Saline was selected as the surrogate matrix, and its suitability was confirmed by good parallelism and accurate quality control sample measurements. Reliable and robust assay performance was demonstrated by precision and accuracy, dilution integrity, sensitivity, recovery and stability, all of which met bioanalysis requirements to support clinical studies. The assay performance was also verified and better understood by comparing it with a colorimetric assay and to a surrogate analyte assay. The newly developed surrogate matrix assay has the potential to be further expanded for urea quantitation in numerous physiological matrices.",Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,37,10,e5713,2025-11-04 10:55:14,2025-11-04 10:55:14

The NiTi rotary instrument breakage is because of cyclic and torsional fatigue. Here the low-voltage (12 V) and high voltage (24 V) electrical treatments were used to enhance the cyclic fatigue of NiTi rotary instruments and increase their durability. In excremental groups, following electrical treatment samples of the NiTi instruments were rotated inside artificial root canals until they broke. Our results showed that electrical treatment with 12-V DC was effective in restoring NiTi instrument's resistance to cyclic fatigue. The scanning electron microscopy images and fractograph of samples exposed to 12-V electrical treatment showed a more regular texture over the surface with less dimpling on fractured site. These patterns can improve the super elasticity of tested devices during rotational movement, and delay the NiTi instruments separation in root canal preparations.",Scanning,Scanning,36,5,507-11,2025-11-04 10:55:16,2025-11-04 10:55:16

In vitro experimental evidence from cultured neonatal animal neurons confirmed the in vivo findings. However, there is no direct clinical evidence of the detrimental effects of anesthetics in human fetuses, infants, or children. Development of an in vitro neurogenesis system using human stem cells has opened up avenues of research for advancing our understanding of human brain development and the issues relevant to anesthetic-induced developmental toxicity in human neuronal lineages. Recent studies from our group, as well as other groups, showed that isoflurane influences human neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis, whereas ketamine induces neuroapoptosis. Application of this high throughput in vitro stem cell neurogenesis approach is a major stride toward ensuring the safety of anesthetic agents in young children. This in vitro human model allows us to (1) screen the toxic effects of various anesthetics under controlled conditions during intense neuronal growth, (2) find the trigger for the anesthetic-induced catastrophic chain of toxic events, and (3) develop prevention strategies to avoid this toxic effect.

The purpose of this hermeneutic-phenomenological study was to describe and understand the problem drinker's lived experience of suffering using a philosophy and research approach which preserves the uniqueness of the experience from the sufferer's point of view. The method involved conducting in-depth interviews with a sample of six problem drinkers. Interviews were analysed using an interpretive process, which aimed at generating a deeper understanding of the topic by facilitating a fusion of the world views of both participant and researcher. A reflexive journal recorded the involvement of the self of the researcher throughout the research process. Suffering was viewed as a spiralling vicious circle of physical, psychological, social and spiritual distress. Symptoms of physical dependence, shame and guilt emerged strongly as being both sequelae of heavy drinking and cues to further drinking bouts.

In the field, ER strains present different levels of virulence, limiting vaccine efficacy, for which the molecular basis remains unknown. Moreover, there are no genetic tools currently available for ER manipulation, thus limiting the knowledge of the genes/proteins that are essential for ER pathogenesis and biology. As such, to identify proteins and/or mechanisms involved in ER virulence, we performed the first exhaustive comparative proteomic analysis between a virulent strain (ERGvir) and its high-passaged attenuated strain (ERGatt). Despite their different behaviors in vivo and in vitro, our results from 1DE-nanoLC-MS/MS showed that ERGvir and ERGatt share 80% of their proteins; this core proteome includes chaperones, proteins involved in metabolism, protein-DNA-RNA biosynthesis and processing, and bacterial effectors. Conventional 2DE revealed that 85% of the identified proteins are proteoforms, suggesting that post-translational modifications (namely glycosylation) are important in ER biology. Strain-specific proteins were also identified: while ERGatt has an increased number and overexpression of proteins involved in cell division, metabolism, transport and protein processing, ERGvir shows an overexpression of proteins and proteoforms (DIGE experiments) involved in pathogenesis such as Lpd, AnkA, VirB9 and B10, providing molecular evidence for its increased virulence in vivo and in vitro. Overall, our work reveals that ERGvir and ERGatt proteomes are streamlined to fulfill their biological function (maximum virulence for ERGvir and replicative capacity for ERGatt), and we provide both pioneering data and novel insights into the pathogenesis of this obligate intracellular bacterium.",PLoS One,PloS one,10,12,e0145328,2025-11-04 10:55:22,2025-11-04 10:55:22

Photoaged skin displays alterations in the cellular component and extracellular matrix with accumulation of disorganized elastin and its microfibrillar component fibrillin in the deep dermis and a severe loss of interstitial collagens, the major structural proteins of the dermal connective tissue. The unifying pathogenic agents for these changes are UV-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) which deplete and damage non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant defense systems of the skin. As well as causing permanent genetic changes, ROS activate cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways in resident fibroblasts that are related to growth, differentiation, senescence and connective tissue degradation. This review focuses on the role of UV-induced ROS in the photodamage of the skin resulting in clinical and biochemical characteristics of photoaging. In addition, the relationship of photoaging to intrinsic aging of the skin will be briefly discussed.

Therefore, it seems that a balanced approach that optimises litter size, litter birthweight, and uniformity of those traits is needed in order to address animal welfare and farm management concerns. This study aimed to investigate this issue by defining several traits for total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA) and litter birthweight (LW). First, the highest value from at least five records per sow was selected as maximum (max) value for each reproduction trait. Second, a mean (mean) for each reproduction trait was calculated per sow. Last, the variability of reproduction traits between parities of the sow was calculated as log-transformed variance of residuals of all observations per sow for each reproduction trait (LnVar). In total, 23 193 Large White sows from Topigs Norsvin with 152 282 litter records were used for analysis in ASReml 4.1. Also, a simulation of breeding schemes was performed with the use of SelAction 2.1 and estimates from genetic analysis. Maximum value of reproductive traits had a much higher heritability than repeated observations or mean of reproduction traits, e.g., 0.31 for maxTNB vs. 0.12 for TNB and 0.07 for meanTNB, which allows for a faster response under selection. The maximum value traits, however, were found to carry more risks, i.e. higher ratio of stillborn (not for maxNBA) and increased variability of traits. Thus, using them in breeding programme should be carefully considered. The genetic coefficient of variation on SD level estimated to indicate the genetic magnitude for variability phenotypes indicated a maximum change of 6-9% in genetic SD of TNB, NBA and LW. The genetic correlations between mean and corresponding variability traits varied from 0.66 to 0.74, whereas the correlation between other mean and variability traits ranged from 0.33 to 0.99. The simulation indicated that even with selection targeted against the variability of reproduction traits, a very limited change should be expected due to a complex genetic and phenotypic relationship between the traits. In the scenarios with selection against LnVarTNB and LnVarLW, this was a decrease of 0.1-0.6% per year, whereas in scenario with selection against LnVarNBA, the range was 0.6-1.1% per year. It is still possible to increase litter size and birthweight further, however, a balance between mean and variability of reproduction traits is required, which can be obtained only by a very well designed breeding programme.",Animal,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,15,10,100352,2025-11-04 10:55:48,2025-11-04 10:55:48

We evaluated the hepatic immunohistochemical expression of the pro-apoptotic bax and the antiapoptotic bcl-xL protein in HBeAg-negative CHB patients before and after treatment. In our study we included 72 paired biopsies from 36 HBeAg-negative CHB patients: 29 treated (interferon-alfa: 17, adefovir: 12) and 7 untreated. Changes in expression of apoptotic proteins (D-bax, D-bcl-xL), necroinflammation and fibrosis (D-grade/D-stage) (Ishak classification) were evaluated. We found that Bax-positive compared to bax-negative biopsies had worse necroinflammation (8.2 vs. 6.7, P = 0.05) and fibrosis score (3.9 vs. 3, P = 0.036). bcl-xL-positive compared to bcl-xL-negative biopsies had lower intralobular inflammation (1.6 vs. 2.2, P = 0.03). Decreased compared to stable/increased D-bax was associated with greater improvement in necroinflammation only in treated patients (D-grade: -4.6 vs. -1.6, P = 0.05) and greater fibrosis improvement in interferon treated patients (D-stage: -0.4 vs. 0.55, P = 0.05). Increased compared to stable/decreased total apoptotic trend [D-apoptosis: (D-bax)-(D-bcl-xL)], was associated with worsening fibrosis, particularly in adefovir treated patients (D-stage: 2.3 vs. 0, P = 0.004). In the 11 patients without significant changes from 1st to 2nd biopsy, increased apoptosis was more frequent in treated than untreated cases (P = 0.046). In multivariate analysis, bax change was independently associated with change of grade (P = 0.038) and antiviral therapy (P = 0.015). In conclusions, in HBeAg-negative CHB, histological improvement after treatment is associated with decreased hepatocyte apoptosis.

Moreover, an inventory of all detectable antibody reactivities to the separated cell envelope antigens of five enterobacterial species suspected of involvement in AS (notably Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia) failed to reveal statistical associations with AS. This might be explained, assuming that the aetiology of AS entails a set of enterobacteria rather than a few individual species.

Whereas ablation of insulin/IGF signaling appears dispensable for GCs and spermatogenesis, adult testes of mice lacking both Insr and Igf1r in SCs (SC-Insr;Igf1r) displayed a 75% reduction in testis size and daily sperm production as a result of a reduced proliferation rate of immature SCs during the late fetal and early neonatal testicular period. In addition, in vivo analyses revealed that FSH requires the insulin/IGF signaling pathway to mediate its proliferative effects on immature SCs. Collectively, these results emphasize the essential role played by growth factors of the insulin family in regulating the final number of SCs, testis size, and daily sperm output.

Ventricular enlargement, another characteristic of SHRs, was observed in adult WKHTs after the onset of hypertension; however, ventricles were already enlarged in normotensive WKHAs at 6 wk. The emergent behavioral profile of WKHAs indicates that they retain the hyperactivity trait and hyperreactivity to stress, and not some of the other behaviors of SHRs, such as poor habituation. Studies in WKHTs suggest that they are an improvement over SHRs as a model of genetic hypertension as they lack some prominent behavioral abnormalities. Nevertheless, the four genetically related strains (WKHA, WKHT, SHR, and WKY), used together, are considered most appropriate for seeking correlations of biological differences with either hypertension or hyperactivity.",Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,261,2 Pt 2,H583-9,2025-11-04 10:55:52,2025-11-04 10:55:52

At this prediabetic stage these rats have hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. It is well known that insulin resistance is frequently associated with renal abnormalities, but the mechanism underlying this association has remained speculative. Although insulin is known to modify renal hemodynamics, little is known about the roles of insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, IRS2) in the renal actions of insulin. To address this issue, the effects of insulin on renal function and renal hemodynamics were investigated in C57BL/6 (WT: wild type), insulin receptor substrate 1- knockout (IRS1-/-), and IRS2-knockout (IRS2-/-) mice. IRS2-/-mice had elevated glucose level as expected. 24-h urine collections and serum creatinine revealed that creatinine clearance did not significantly differ between these groups. Albuminuria was found in IRS1-/-and IRS2-/-groups. We examined the effects on the IRS during the administration of Losartan, which is widely used for diabetic nephropathy. After the administration of Losartan the IRS displayed improved renal hemodynamics. Moreover, the subjects were also given Pioglitazone, which improves insulin resistance. Losartan significantly reduced albuminuria in both groups. Pioglitazone also showed similar results. We assessed the autoregulatory responses of the total renal blood flow (RBF), the superficial (SBF) and the deep renal cortical blood flow (DBF) with stepwise reductions of renal perfusion pressure (RPP), which was induced by a manual clamp on the abdominal aorta. During the clamp induced reductions of the RPP by 10 to 20mm HG, RBF, SBF and the DBF fell significantly more in the IRS1 and IRS2 than in the WT mice. Furthermore micropuncture studies showded that compared to the WT tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) responses of the stop flow pressure (Psf) were reduced in both the IRS1 -/- and IRS2 -/-. The results of the IRS1 and IRS2 mice displayed the pressence of hemodynamic abnormalities. Losartan and Pioglitazone have shown the potential to improve these abnormalities. In conclusion the results indicate that IRS plays a major role in the stimulation of renal functions and renal hemodynamics in type type II diabetes.",PLoS One,PloS one,15,12,e0242332,2025-11-04 10:55:53,2025-11-04 10:55:53

Reflections on Improvement Science as a Paradigm.","Responding to this issue's invitation to bring new disciplinary insights to the field of improvement science, this article takes as its starting point one of the field's guiding metaphors: the imperative to ""mind the gap"". Drawing on insights from anthropology, history, and philosophy, the article reflects on the origins and implications of this metaphoric imperative, and suggests some ways in which it might be in tension with the means and ends of improvement. If the industrial origins of improvement science in the twentieth century inform a metaphor of gaps, chasms, and spaces of misalignment as invariably imperfect and potentially dangerous, and therefore requiring bridging or closure, other currents that feed the discipline of improvement science suggest the potential value and uses of spaces of openness and ambiguity. These currents include the science of complex adaptive systems, and certain precepts of philosophical pragmatism acknowledged to inform improvement science. Going a step further, I reflect on whether or not these two contrasting approaches within improvement science should be treated as incommensurable paradigms, and what each approach tells us about the very possibility of accommodating seemingly irreconcilable or incommensurable approaches within improvement science.",Health Care Anal,Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,26,2,124-139,2025-11-04 10:55:57,2025-11-04 10:55:57

Epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics, with particular attention paid to juveniles, whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes. However, little is understood about bat immunology, including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates. Understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations, which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans. We conducted two separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1) canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus; and 2) Hendra virus in wild-caught, naturally infected Pteropus alecto. Both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses. We found that in both species, antibodies were transferred from dam to pup. In P. hypomelanus pups, titers against CDV waned over a mean period of 228.6 days (95% CI: 185.4-271.8) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 96.0 days (CI 95%: 30.7-299.7).

Each species showed a duration of transferred maternal immunity of between 7.5 and 8.5 months, which was longer than has been previously estimated.

MRI enhancement of perfused tissues using chromium labeled red blood cells as an intravascular contrast agent.,"It has been demonstrated that chromium (Cr) labeling significantly decreases the relaxation times of packed red blood cells (RBCs). In this study, the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of human red cells was shortened from 836 ms to 29 ms and the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) shortened from 134 ms to 18 ms, when the cells were labeled at a Cr incubation concentration of 50 mM. Labeling of canine cells at 50 mM resulted in a T1 of 36 ms and a T2 of 26 ms. A labeling concentration of 10 mM produced similar relaxation enhancement, with uptake of 47% of the available Cr, and was determined to be optimal. The enhancement of longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (1/T1,-1/T2) per amount of hemoglobin-bound Cr are 6.9 s-1 mM-1 and 9.8 s-1 mM-1 respectively, different from those of a pure Cr+3 solution. Labeling cells at 10 mM decreased the survival half-time in vivo from 16.6 days to 4.7 days in dogs. No difference in red cell survival was found with the use of hetero-transfusion versus auto-transfusion of labeled RBCs. Significant shortening of the T1 (912 ms to 266 ms, P = .03) and T2 (90 ms to 70 ms, P = .006) of spleen and the T1 (764 ms to 282 ms, P = .005) and the T2 (128 ms to 86 ms, P = .005) of liver occurred when 10% of the RBC mass of dogs was exchanged with Cr labeled cells. Liver and spleen spin density changes (P greater than 0.23) and muscle spin density and relaxation changes (P greater than 0.4) were insignificant. The in vivo T1 of a canine spleen which had been infarcted did not change following transfusion with labeled cells, where the T1 of liver did shorten.

1603606,W P Garth,1992,Current concepts regarding the anterior cruciate ligament.,"In an athlete, the torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is best managed by surgical reconstruction. The failure to recognize an acutely torn ACL and the resulting inappropriate treatment can result in additional irreversible damage to the athlete's knee. Yet, as recently as 1983, a report documented that physicians failed to diagnose acutely torn ACLs in 93% of 103 patients who were subsequently seen with symptomatically unstable knees. Persistent instability is manifested by paroxysmal anterior shifts of the tibia on the femur during pivotal maneuvers, which may cause further irreparable damage. The injury has commonly gone unrecognized despite the fact that knowledge of the ACL's function, mechanism of its injury, and clinical presentation when torn can often lead to a strong suspicion of a torn ACL through history-taking alone. Documentation of hemarthrosis and a poor end point to passive tibial anterior displacement on the femur while the knee is between 10 degrees and 30 degrees of flexion confirms the diagnosis. Arthroscopically aided intra-articular reconstruction has emerged as the favored technique over extra-articular and combined intra-articular/extra-articular procedures. The bone-one-third patella tendon-bone autogenous graft remains the standard to which other graft materials are compared in reconstructing the ligament. Allograft reconstruction offers similar results with less postoperative morbidity and is reasonably safe; the spread of human immunodeficiency virus from donor to patient remains a remote possibility.",Orthop Rev,Orthopaedic review,21,5,565-75,2025-11-04 10:56:00,2025-11-04 10:56:00

We hypothesized that, when a basketball player increases or decreases the frequency of his limb motion in a vertical ball-bouncing task, the transformation should be characterized as adiabatic. Confirmation of this hypothesis would lend support to the body of knowledge that suggests that physical-biological laws guide the behavior of people engaged in motor tasks, including their acquisition of skill. We videotaped and analyzed four participants - two intermediates and two experts - bouncing a ball from various heights, and measured the energy and kinematic relations of the ball and the participants' body segments. The task presents a challenge to certain predictions of the adiabatic hypothesis in evaluating changes in movement velocity (v) or frequency (f), and energy as adiabatic transformations. Among these are the constant relation between kinetic energy (Ek) per cycle and v, constancy of energy dissipated per cycle (Et) over changes in v and Ek, the ratio of Ek to Et per cycle (the ""Q"" values), and the relation of amplitude to v. From our observations, which are examined in regard to the insights of Kugler and Turvey about the relation of Ehrenfest's adiabatic theorem to biological systems, we confirm the basic adiabatic character of the task in analyzing both the ball alone and the relations of various body segments.

Recruitment began in November 1996 and will continue for 1.5 years. Patients are randomized to receive either low-dose amiodarone or conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Patients assigned to the amiodarone group will receive an oral loading regimen of 10 mg/kg/day during a minimum 14-day period. Patients assigned to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy will receive 1 of 2 agents commonly used in AF prophylaxis: sotalol or propafenone. Drug selection and loading, and electrical cardioversion, if necessary, will be performed within 21 days of randomization. The long-term maintenance dose of amiodarone is 200 mg/day.

Approximate dynamic programming implemented with an Adaptive Critic (AC) neural network structure has evolved as a powerful alternative technique that obviates the need for excessive computations and storage requirements in solving optimal control problems. In this paper, an improvement to the AC architecture, called the ""Single Network Adaptive Critic (SNAC)"" is presented. This approach is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear systems where the optimal control (stationary) equation can be explicitly expressed in terms of the state and costate variables. The selection of this terminology is guided by the fact that it eliminates the use of one neural network (namely the action network) that is part of a typical dual network AC setup. As a consequence, the SNAC architecture offers three potential advantages: a simpler architecture, lesser computational load and elimination of the approximation error associated with the eliminated network. In order to demonstrate these benefits and the control synthesis technique using SNAC, two problems have been solved with the AC and SNAC approaches and their computational performances are compared. One of these problems is a real-life Micro-Electro-Mechanical-system (MEMS) problem, which demonstrates that the SNAC technique is applicable to complex engineering systems.",Neural Netw,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,19,10,1648-60,2025-11-04 10:56:04,2025-11-04 10:56:04

This diabetes-induced change was associated with a marked impairment in the hepatic glutathione antioxidant/detoxification response to CCl4 challenge, as indicated by the abrogation of the increases in hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) level, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and microsomal glutathione S-transferases (GST) activities upon challenge with increasing doses of CCl4. While the hepatic GSH level was increased in diabetic rats, the hepatic mitochondrial GSH level and Se-glutathione peroxidase activity were significantly reduced. Insulin treatment could reverse most of the biochemical alterations induced by diabetes. Both insulin and schisandrin B (Sch B) pretreatments protected against the CCl4 hepatotoxicity in diabetic rats. The hepatoprotection was associated with improvement in hepatic glutathione redox status in both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, as well as the increases in hepatic ascorbic acid level and microsomal GST activity. The ensemble of results suggests that the diabetes-induced impairment in hepatic mitochondrial glutathione redox status may at least in part be attributed to the enhanced susceptibility to CCl4 hepatotoxicity.

Hepatic iron accumulation, as well as oxidative DNA damage, is significantly increased in NASH livers. However, the precise mechanism of iron accumulation in the NASH liver remains unclear. In this study, 40 cases with a diagnosis of NASH (n = 25) or simple steatosis (SS; n = 15) by liver biopsy were enrolled. An oral iron absorption test (OIAT) was used, in which 100 mg of sodium ferrous citrate was administered to each individual. The OIAT showed that absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was increased significantly in NASH patients, compared to SS and control subjects. Iron reduction therapy was effective in patients with NASH, who exhibited iron deposition in the liver and no alanine aminotransferase improvement after other therapies (n = 9). Serum hepcidin concentration and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) also were significantly elevated in patients with NASH. OIAT results were correlated with grade of liver iron accumulation and DMT1 mRNA levels. Then, we demonstrated that DMT1 mRNA levels increased significantly in Caco-2/TC7 cell monolayers cultured in transwells with serum from NASH patients.

(1973) Nature New Biol. 245, 6-8) of molecular weights 60,000 and 35,000, respectively. The phi X A* protein is formed from a natural internal initiator site within the A gene cistron while the phi X A protein is the product of the entire A gene. These two proteins have been purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Previous studies have shown that the phi X A protein is an endonuclease which specifically introduces a discontinuity in the A cistron of the viral strand of supertwisted phi XRFI DNA. In addition to this activity, the phi X A protein also causes relaxation of supertwisted phi XRFI DNA and formation of a phi XRFH DNA . phi X A protein complex which has a discontinuity in the A cistron of the viral strand. This isolatable complex supports DNA synthesis when supplemented with extracts of uninfected Escherichia coli which lack phi X A protein and phi XRFI DNA. The phi XRFII DNA . phi X A protein complex can be attacked by exonuclease III but is not susceptible to attack by E. coli DNA polymerase I, indicating that the 5'-end of the complex is blocked. Attempts to seal the RFII structure generated from the phi XRFII DNA . phi X A protein complex with T4 DNA ligase in the presence or absence of DNA polymerase were unsuccessful. The phi X A protein does not act catalytically in the cleavage of phi XRFI DNA. Under conditions leading to the quantitative cleavage of phi XRFI DNA, the molar ratio of phi XRFI DNA to added phi X A protein was approximately 1:10. At this molar ratio, cross-linking experiments with dimethyl suberimidate yielded 10 distinct protein bands which were multiples of the monomeric phi X A protein. In the absence of DNA or in the presence of inactive DNA (phi XRFII DNA) no distinct protein bands above a trimer were detected. We found it possible in vitro to form a phi XRFII DNA . phi X A protein complex with wild-type phi XRFI DNA (phi X A gene+) and with phi XRFI DNA isolated from E. coli (su+) infected with phage phi X H90 (an am mutant in the phi X A gene). Thus, in vitro, in contrast to in vivo studies, phi X A protein is not a cis acting protein. The purified phi X A* protein does not substitute for the phi X A protein in in vitro replication of phi XRFI DNA nor does it interfere with the action of the phi X A protein which binds only to supertwisted phi XRFI DNA. In contrast, the phi X A* protein binds to all duplex DNA preparations tested.

Its mechanism of action is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the sites of MC 540-mediated photodamages in L1210 leukemia cells by examining the effects of MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation on several soluble and membrane-bound marker enzymes. When exposed to MC 540 and white light under a standard set of conditions, the activities of Na+/K(+)-ATPase, Mg2(+)-ATPase, and 5'-nucleotidase (three plasma membrane-bound enzymes) were reduced by 54, 49, and 55%, respectively. None of the intracellular enzymes included in this survey was affected by MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation as long as the plasma membrane remained intact. The two soluble enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, remained refractory to MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation even after the plasma membrane had been disrupted. By contrast, the activities of the membrane-bound enzymes, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and succinate dehydrogenase, were reduced in cell lysates by 55 and 81%, respectively. Purified NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was about 3 times less sensitive than the microsomal enzyme, suggesting that the membrane environment facilitated photoinactivation. The MC 540-sensitized photoinactivation of enzymes was accelerated in the presence of deuterium oxide and inhibited if oxygen in the medium was displaced by nitrogen or azide was added to the medium. Taken together, these data support the view that the plasma membrane is a major target of MC 540-mediated photodamages, that the inactivation of membrane-bound enzymes is an oxidative process, and that at least some photodynamic damages are mediated by type II chemistry.",Cancer Res,Cancer research,50,24,7765-9,2025-11-04 10:56:13,2025-11-04 10:56:13

Most of these cell lines displayed punctate p53 and mortalin localization in the cell cytoplasm with the exception of HCT-8 and HCT116 379.2 cells, where p53 was not detected. Nuclear p53 was only observed in HCT-116 40-16, LS123, and HT-29 cell lines. Mortalin was only localized in the cytoplasm in all cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry revealed that p53 and mortalin were bound and co-localized in the cytoplasmic fraction of four cell lines, HCT-116 (40-16 and 386; parental and heterozygous fractions respectively of the same cell line), HT-29, LS123 and LoVo, implying that p53 nuclear function is limited in those cell lines by being restricted to the cytoplasm. Mortalin gene expression levels were higher than gene expression levels of p53 in all cell lines. Cell lines with cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, however, also displayed elevated p53 gene expression levels compared to cell lines without p53 sequestration. Our data reveal the characteristic cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the heat shock protein mortalin in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, as is the case for other cancers, such as glioblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,423,2,411-6,2025-11-04 10:56:23,2025-11-04 10:56:23
16490412,"Paul E Holtzheimer, Charles B Nemeroff",2006,Advances in the treatment of depression.,"Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Currently available treatments for depression include tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, various atypical antidepressants, and electroconvulsive therapy. Although these treatments are effective, a significant number of patients do not respond or achieve sustained remission despite aggressive management. Advances in the neurobiology of depression have suggested a number of novel targets for antidepressant treatment. Based on an improved understanding of the neurobiology of depression, several novel pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are being developed. Pharmacologic developments include CRF antagonists, glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, substance P receptor antagonists, NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, transdermal selegiline, so-called ""triple"" reuptake inhibitors, and augmentation of typical antidepressant medications with atypical antipsychotics. Nonpharmacologic advances have largely involved focal brain stimulation techniques including vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, and deep brain stimulation. For the most part, the data on these treatments are preliminary, and more study is needed to clarify their potential clinical benefit. However, it is clear that further study of the neurobiology of depression will continue to provide a rationale for developing innovative targets for antidepressant therapies.",NeuroRx,NeuroRx : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,3,1,42-56,2025-11-04 10:56:24,2025-11-04 10:56:24

ApoE also inhibits mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and gonadotropin-stimulated ovarian theca/interstitial cell androgen production. To address the mechanism(s) by which apoE is active and to understand its interaction with the target cells, we prepared and examined the inhibitory activity of a series of apoE synthetic peptides. ApoE peptides representing amino acid residues 93-112, 141-155, 161-171, 172-182, and 174-193 were not active in either bioassay.

Movements in upward (against gravity) and downward (with gravity) directions, with two different mass loads (hand empty and with a hand-held 0.5-kg weight) were executed by eight subjects in a normal gravitational environment. Movements by two cosmonauts, in the two directions, were also tested in a state of weightlessness. Analyses focused upon finger trajectories in the sagittal plane. Subjects in a normal gravitational environment showed curved paths for both directions and weight conditions. In addition, downward movements showed significantly smaller curvatures than upward movements. Movement times were approximately the same for all the experimental conditions. Curvature differences between upward and downward movements persisted during space flight and immediately postflight. Movement times from both cosmonauts increased slightly during flight, but returned to normal immediately on reentry in a one-G environment. Results from the present study provide evidence that gravity is centrally represented in an anticipatory fashion as a driving force during vertical arm movement planning.",Exp Brain Res,Experimental brain research,120,4,496-502,2025-11-04 10:56:34,2025-11-04 10:56:34

The centrosome, introduced by the sperm at fertilization, organizes a microtubule array that is responsible for bringing the parental genomes together at first mitosis. Incomplete functioning of the sperm centrosome during fertilization has been identified as a novel form of infertility that would not necessarily benefit from intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The global use of ICSI to overcome male infertility has been very successful, although concerns remain regarding the long-term effects on children born after ICSI. The cytoskeletal events that occur during ICSI are quite different from the events of in vitro fertilization: a sperm selected for ICSI does not undergo typical oocyte interactions, and abnormal remodelling of the male pronucleus may result. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the safety of the ICSI technique.",Hum Fertil (Camb),"Human fertility (Cambridge, England)",5,3,110-6,2025-11-04 10:56:37,2025-11-04 10:56:37

SHI is a nonlinear contrast-specific ultrasound imaging technique in which pulses are received at half the frequency of the transmitted pulses. A Logiq 9 scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was modified to operate in grayscale SHI mode (transmitting/receiving at 4.4/2.2 MHz) and used to scan 14 women with 16 breast lesions. Manual CMI images were reconstructed by temporal maximum-intensity projection of pixels traced from the first frame to the last. In the new automated technique, the user selects a kernel in the first frame and the algorithm then uses the sum of absolute difference (SAD) technique to identify motion-induced displacements in the remaining frames. A reliability parameter was used to estimate the accuracy of the motion tracking based on the ratio of the minimum SAD to the average SAD. Two thresholds (the mean and 85% of the mean reliability parameter) were used to eliminate images plagued by excessive motion and/or noise. The automated algorithm was compared with the manual technique for computational time, correction of motion artifacts, removal of noisy frames and quality of the final image. The automated algorithm compensated for motion artifacts and noisy frames. The computational time was 2 min compared with 60-90 minutes for the manual method. The quality of the motion-compensated CMI-SHI images generated by the automated technique was comparable to the manual method and provided a snapshot of the microvasculature showing interconnections between vessels, which was less evident in the original data. In conclusion, an automated algorithm for producing CMI-SHI images has been developed. It eliminates the need for manual processing and yields reproducible images, thereby increasing the throughput and efficiency of reconstructing CMI-SHI images.

The impact of the Flexner Report on medical education for racial and ethnic minority physicians in the United States.,"The publication of the Flexner Report in 1910 had an immediate and enduring impact on the training of African American physicians in the United States. The Flexner Report's thesis, ""that the country needs fewer and better doctors,"" was intended to normalize medical education for the majority of physicians, but its implementation just 48 years after the Emancipation Proclamation obstructed opportunities for African Americans pursuing medical education and restricted the production of physicians capable of addressing the health needs of a nation that would grow increasingly diverse across the century.This article provides a working definition of structural racism within academic medicine, reviews the significant physician workforce diversity initiatives of the past four decades, and suggests the most successful of these possess strategies common to addressing structural racism (community empowerment, collaboration, clear and measurable goals, leadership, and durable resources). Stymied by popular ballot initiatives, relentless legal challenges, and dwindling funds, current and future efforts to increase diversity in medicine must maintain a focus on addressing the active remnants of structural racism while they build on the broad benefits of diversity in education and medicine. Despite creative and tireless efforts, no significant progress in expanding diversity within the U.S. physician workforce can be made absent a national effort to address this enduring barrier in the collective social, economic, and political institutions.

In contrast, the synthesis of PsaA (DeltaA31-DeltaS32) in Y. pestis and delivery to the supernatant was decreased. Otherwise, substitution of the amino acid cysteine at position 26 by valine involved in the SPase-II cleavage site did not show any effect on the secretion of PsaA in Salmonella and Yersinia.

20181668,"Kenneth R Hallows, Peter F Mount, Núria M Pastor-Soler, David A Power",2010,Role of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase in renal physiology and disease.,"The ultrasensitive energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) orchestrates the regulation of energy-generating and energy-consuming pathways. AMPK is highly expressed in the kidney where it is reported to be involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including ion transport, podocyte function, and diabetic renal hypertrophy. Sodium transport is the major energy-consuming process in the kidney, and AMPK has been proposed to contribute to the coupling of ion transport with cellular energy metabolism. Specifically, AMPK has been identified as a regulator of several ion transporters of significance in renal physiology, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC), and the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). Identified regulators of AMPK in the kidney include dietary salt, diabetes, adiponectin, and ischemia. Activation of AMPK in response to adiponectin is described in podocytes, where it reduces albuminuria, and in tubular cells, where it reduces glycogen accumulation. Reduced AMPK activity in the diabetic kidney is associated with renal accumulation of triglyceride and glycogen and the pathogenesis of diabetic renal hypertrophy. Acute renal ischemia causes a rapid and powerful activation of AMPK, but the functional significance of this observation remains unclear. Despite the recent advances, there remain significant gaps in the present understanding of both the upstream regulating pathways and the downstream substrates for AMPK in the kidney. A more complete understanding of the AMPK pathway in the kidney offers potential for improved therapies for several renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injury.",Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The majority of clinically diagnosed glomerulonephritides cannot be successfully treated according to current knowledge. Clinical findings, therefore, must help to decide where a biopsy should be performed or where one can do without histologic evidence without any disadvantage for the patient. The diagnosis of ""glomerular disease"" can be made by examination of erythrocyte morphology in the urine and from urinary protein pattern by poyacrylic-gel-electrophoreses. Having obtained this diagnosis, the indication for biopsy is possible, if a system of clinically defined stage is applied, as acute-, oligosymptomatic- and chronic progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome. A biopsy should be taken in any case of the nephrotic syndrome and urgently in the case of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Combined immunosuppressive treatment eventually in conjunction with plasmaphoresis has improved the prognosis of RPGN essentially and a biopsy should then be taken as soon as possible. It would be desirable, therefore, for the clinician if he could get the pathologists findings even on weekends or on holidays, to avoid any delay in starting the treatment. Special treatment regimes usually are chosen according to morphologically defined subgroups of glomerulonephritides.

Here, we compared the genetic programming and signaling of SMCs in collagen matrix as a three-dimensional (3-D) environment and on a two-dimensional (2-D) surface. By using DNA microarrays with 9600 genes, we showed that 77 genes were expressed more than twofold and 22 genes were less than one-half in 3-D matrix, when compared with the 2-D condition. The higher expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) in 3-D matrix suggests that p21 may be responsible for the lower proliferation rate in 3-D matrix. The expression level of collagen I was higher in 3-D matrix, suggesting that SMCs in 3-D matrix have increased matrix synthesis. In addition, SMCs in 3-D matrix had less stress fibers and focal adhesions, and a lower level of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Overexpression of FAK attenuated the expression of p21 and collagen I in 3-D matrix, suggesting that FAK functions as a molecular switch for cell cycle regulation and matrix synthesis.

The method is based on the use of dual molecule consisting of a fluorescent chromophore and a nitroxide radical. In the dual molecule, the nitroxide acts as a quencher of the fluorescence of the chromophore fragment. Reduction of the nitroxide fragment by ascorbic acid results in decay of ESR signal and enhancement of the fluorescence. By performing the series of pseudo-first-order reactions between the dual molecule and ascorbic acid and consequent plotting rate constants versus ascorbic acid concentrations the calibration curves for the vitamin C analysis were obtained. Variations of chemical structure of fluorophore and nitroxide fragments allow to regulate fluorescent properties and redox potentials of the dual molecules. The proposed fluorophore-nitroxide hybrids retain all features of the spin labels and fluorescence probes gaining new advantages for monitoring redox reactions and radical processes by two independent techniques: ESR and steady-state fluorescent spectroscopy.

Several of these variables were significantly higher in all hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects, but cigarette smoking and gamma-GT levels were predominantly or exclusively higher in PSH patients. In a second stage, correlations between differential BP and the variables listed above were studied in subjects with two levels of diastolic BP: 70-79 and 80-89 mmHg, thus taking into account all degrees between normal BP and PSH proper. Weakly positive correlations were found with alcohol consumption, plasma gamma-GT and glucose levels, and with percentages of smokers or ex-smokers.

In this review, the roles of anti-apoptotic proteins that are upregulated in RA synovial joints will be discussed in relation to their actions on bone destruction and inflammation. Evidence recently published suggests that intracellular apoptotic inhibitory molecules can be targeted by current or new therapeutics to reduce joint damage in RA.

Pulsed pump-probe lasers are the preferred instruments for characterizing periodic multilayer stacks from common vacuum deposition techniques, but the detection mechanism requires the injected sound wave to maintain coherence during propagation. Beyond acoustic Bragg mirrors, frequency-domain studies using a tandem Fabry-Perot interferometer (TFPI) find dispersions of two- and three-dimensional phononic crystals (PnCs) even for highly disordered samples, but with the caveat that PnCs must be transparent. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid technique for overcoming the limitations that time- and frequency-domain approaches exhibit separately. Accordingly, we inject coherent phonons into a non-transparent PnC using a pulsed laser and acquire the acoustic transmission spectrum on a TFPI, where pumped appear alongside spontaneously excited (i.e. incoherent) phonons.

This has been suggested as a method of detecting and selecting for increased photosynthetic efficiency among C3 genotypes. The C4 plant should, in such conditions, reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration below the compensation point of the C3 plant, resulting in its eventual death. Significant differences were found among the A. thaliana races for survival time; some races survived only one week in competition with corn while others survived more than two weeks. Two races, chosen for contrasting survival in closed chambers, were hybridized and compared to their F2 progeny for survival time. Substantial genetic segregation occurred among the F2, and a number of transgressive segregates having survival times superior of both parents were identified. Also significant heterosis was observed in the F2 population.",Theor Appl Genet,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics.

The TME is composed of tumor cells, stromal cells, cytokines, and chemotactic factors of which fibroblasts are the main cellular components. In our present study, we found that colorectal cancer (CRC) cells expressing integrin αvβ6 clearly could induce morphological changes in inactive fibroblasts and increased the expression of activated fibroblast markers such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast-activating protein (FAP). Those activated fibroblasts in the TME are called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In order to investigate the mechanism by which CRC cells expressing integrin αvβ6 activated CAFs, a series of assays have been carried out in the follow-up. We found that CRC cells could secrete inactive transforming growth factor β (TGF-β); however, integrin αvβ6 activated TGF-β, which subsequently activated fibroblasts. This process was disrupted by knockdown of integrin αvβ6. In contrast, activated fibroblasts could promote CRC cell invasion. In particular, the strengthening effect on expression of integrin αvβ6 in colon cancer cells was obvious. Additionally, we found that CAFs could secrete stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and promote CRC cell metastasis in distant organs via the SDF-1/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis. Taken together, we assumed that CRC cells and CAFs activated one another and worked together to promote cancer progression, with integrin αvβ6 playing a role in the bi-directional regulation of these cells. Hence, integrin αvβ6 may serve as a therapeutic target for the future CRC treatment.",Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,38,6,N/A,2025-11-04 10:57:06,2025-11-04 10:57:06

The effects of pH, flow rate, and influent perchlorate and nitrate concentrations on perchlorate reduction were investigated. Excellent perchlorate removal performance (> or = 99%) was achieved at empty bed residence times (EBRTs) ranging from 0.3 to 63 h and an influent perchlorate concentration of 40-600 microg L(-1). At the longest liquid residence times, when the influent pH was above 7.5, a significant increase of the effluent pH was observed (pH > 10.0), which led to a decrease of perchlorate removal. Experiments at short residence times revealed that the ZVI column inoculated with local soil (Colton, CA) containing a mixed culture of denitrifiers exhibited much better performance than the columns inoculated with Dechloromonas sp. HZ for reduction of both perchlorate and nitrate. As the flow rate was varied between 2 and 50 mL min(-1), corresponding to empty bed contact times of 0.15-3.8 h, a maximum perchlorate elimination capacity of 3.0 +/- 0.7 g m(-3) h(-1) was obtained in a soil-inoculated column.

The mass of microorganisms attached on the solid ZVI/sand was found to be 3 orders of magnitude greater than that in the pore liquid, indicating that perchlorate was primarily reduced by bacteria attached to ZVI.

This study is a randomized, double-blind, active comparator clinical trial in which a subset of patients had some pharmacokinetic measurements. The setting was an outpatient private infertility clinic in a developing country, and the subjects were 171 patients with hyperprolactinemia. A pilot phase comprised 32 patients who were divided into 2 groups. Group A comprised 16 patients who used vaginal suppositories containing 2.5 mg bromocriptine mesthylate with pluronics and bioadhesive agents once daily for 1 month, while group B included 16 patients who used commercial 2.5-mg bromocriptine mesthylate tablets inserted vaginally once daily for 1 month. The clinical phase comprised 139 patients who were again divided into 2 groups in the same way (group A, 68 patients; group B, 71 patients). Serum prolactin (SP) was measured before and after therapy in all cases. The main outcome measure was the decline of SP level after 1 month of therapy. In both groups, there was a significant decline of the SP. However, it was more significant in group A. Patient convenience was more evident, and local side effects were less in group A than group B in the clinical phase. The introduction of bioadhesive technology for bromocriptine mesylate/pluronic F-126 administration is valuable in achieving prominent serum prolactin reduction in hyperprolactinemic patients in a relatively short duration of therapy.

Dougl. ex J. Forbes and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. growing adjacent to each other in an old-growth forest in southwestern Washington State, USA. We hypothesized that, despite contrasting branching patterns and crown architectures, the two species should exhibit convergence in leaf display and photosynthetic gain per light intercepting area, because these are important properties determining their survival in the light-limited understory. The branching pattern of A. amabilis was regular (normal shoot-length distribution, less variable branching angle and bifurcation ratio), whereas that of T. heterophylla was more plastic (positively skewed shoot-length distribution, more variable branching angle and bifurcation ratio). The two species had similar shoot morphologies: number of leaves per unit shoot length and leaf to axis dry mass ratio. Leaf morphology, in contrast, was significantly different. Leaves of A. amabilis were larger and heavier than those of T. heterophylla, which resulted in lower mass-based photosynthetic rate for A. amabilis. Despite these differences, the two species had similar levels of leaf overlap and area-based photosynthetic characteristics. Needle longevity of A. amabilis was nearly twice that of T. heterophylla. The leaf N contents of current and 1-year-old leaves were lower for A. amabilis than for T. heterophylla. However, the leaf N content of A. amabilis did not change from current leaves to 6-year-old leaves, whereas that of T. heterophylla decreased with increasing leaf age. Abies amabilis had deeper crowns than T. heterophylla and retained branches with low relative growth rates. Longer branch retention may compensate for the lower branch-level assimilation rate of A. amabilis. We inferred that the convergence of leaf display and photosynthetic characteristics between A. amabilis and T. heterophylla may contribute to the persistence of both species in the understory of this forest.",Tree Physiol,Tree physiology,29,8,989-98,2025-11-04 10:57:13,2025-11-04 10:57:13

Passive and active vibration methods, such as acoustic emissions and modal analysis, are extensively used in both industry and the medical field to diagnose structural faults and disorders. To maximize the diagnostic potential of such vibration methods for knee injuries and disorders, a better understanding of the vibroacoustic characteristics of the knee must be developed. In this study, the linearity and vibration transmissibility of the human knee were investigated based on measurements collected on healthy subjects. Different subjects exhibit a substantially different transmissibility behavior due to variances in subject-specific knee structures. Moreover, the vibration behaviors of various subjects' knees at different leg positions were compared. Variation in sagittal-plane knee angle alters the transmissibility of the joint, while the overall shape of the transmissibility diagrams remains similar. The results demonstrate that an adjusted stimulation signal at frequencies higher than 3 kHz has the potential to be employed in diagnostic applications that are related to knee joint health. This work can pave the way for future studies aimed at employing acoustic emission and modal analysis approaches for knee health monitoring outside of clinical settings, such as for field-deployable diagnostics.",Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",20,15,N/A,2025-11-04 10:57:15,2025-11-04 10:57:15

Socioeconomic indicators and major CHD risk factors (BMI, SBP, DBP, TOT-CH, HDL-CH and TRIG) were measured in 15,315 males aged 40-69 years; mortality data by cause were collected for the next six years. CHD mortality risk ratio (RR) in the different educational and occupational levels and by residence was computed by Cox proportional hazards models. The association between socioeconomic indicators and CHD risk factors was explored by covariance and logistic regression analysis. After six years, 632 men died, 181 of whom because of coronary fatalities. No association with educational level was found for CHD mortality (RR = 1.00 high, 0.69 intermediate, 0.92 low), nor did occupational level show a significant association. Urban vs rural residence (RR = 1.00) showed a RR for CHD mortality of 1.35. Adjustment for bio-behavioral risk factors did not change the above results; only mortality for CHD of urban vs rural residents increased (RR = 1.63, p < 0.003). By considering the interaction between schooling and occupation, it was found that education appropriated to occupational level was a protective factor. The study does not indicate any association between education/occupational level and CHD mortality in male RIFLE population samples.

Here, we isolated catechin and epicatechin from S. chinae rhizome and also studied their neuroprotective effects on Abeta (25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat cortical neurons. Catechin and epicatechin inhibited 10 microM Abeta (25-35)-induced neuronal cell death at a concentration of 10 microM, which was measured by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Hoechst 33342 staining. Catechin and epicatechin inhibited 10 microM Abeta (25-35)-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c), which was measured by a fluorescent dye, Fluo-4 AM. Catechin and epicatechin also inhibited glutamate release into medium induced by 10 microM Abeta (25-35), which was measured by HPLC, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of caspase-3. These results suggest that catechin and epicatechin prevent Abeta (25-35)-induced neuronal cell damage by interfering with the increase of [Ca2+]c, and then by inhibiting glutamate release, generation of ROS and caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, these effects of catechin and epicatechin may be associated with the neuroprotective effect of the S. chinae rhizome.",Life Sci,Life sciences,79,24,2251-9,2025-11-04 10:57:24,2025-11-04 10:57:24

SPVD has been known there since at least the 1940s, although it took several decades to elucidate its aetiology. It occurs throughout Africa and is particularly prevalent in the Great Lakes region. Production of sweet potato is largely by resource-poor farmers, growing mostly local landraces and for home consumption and so control strategies need to be appropriate to these circumstances. Most high yielding and/or early maturing landraces in Uganda are susceptible to SPVD and most resistant landraces are low-yielding, forcing farmers to compromise between the conflicting requirements of large and/or early yields, and food security. Accordingly, two strategies were tested to avoid the disadvantages associated with such compromises. These were deploying high-yielding SPVD-resistant cultivars and phytosanitation practices to enable susceptible landraces to be grown successfully. In on-farm trials in Masaka and Rakai Districts of Uganda, some SPVD-resistant cultivars bred at Namulonge Agricultural and Animal Research Station (NAARI), in Wakiso District, out-yielded local landraces. Other trials at NAARI and at nearby farms showed that roguing diseased cuttings within 1 month of planting and isolation from diseased crops, even by as little as 15m, can considerably decrease spread of SPVD to susceptible cultivars. This indicates that phytosanitation can protect desirable susceptible cultivars, even if adopted only locally. A dual approach of deploying both resistant varieties and phytosanitation provides farmers with a valuable increase in their choice of control strategies for SPVD.",Virus Res,Virus research,100,1,115-22,2025-11-04 10:57:26,2025-11-04 10:57:26

To enable prediction of these volumetric changes, we provide mathematical expressions that describe the dynamics of the triple ring. Volumes of the three regions on image-fused control CT/MR images were measured for a 24-month period. The delivered dose on the tumor surface was 50-60 Gy. Dose planning and image fusion were performed with Brain-Lab Target 1.19 software; mathematical and statistical computations were carried out with Matlab numeric computation and visualization software. To determine the volumes, control images with the triple rings were fused with the planning images. Relative volumes normalized with respect to the volume of reference dose were calculated and plotted in the time domain. First, the mean values of volumes were determined from the patients' measured data; then, polynomials were fitted to the mean values using the polynomial curve-fitting method. The accuracy of our results was verified by correlating the predicted data with the measured ones. The polynomial prediction approach proposed here reveals the dynamics of the triple ring.

However, few studies have specifically examined docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid with limited availability in its pure form. We hypothesized that DPA would have lipid-lowering effects and improve insulin resistance in KK/Ta mice. To test our hypothesis, 7-week-old KK/Ta mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce obesity before being divided into 3 groups and fed an experimental diet for 10 weeks. The experimental diets were: LSO, using lard and safflower oil as fat sources; SO, in which lard in the LSO diet was replaced with safflower oil; and DPA, in which lard in the LSO diet was replaced with DPA oil. After 10 weeks, plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations were significantly decreased in the DPA group, but not in the SO group. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 gene expressions involved in fatty acid synthesis in the liver were significantly lower in the DPA group compared with the LSO group. Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly decreased in both the SO group and the DPA group compared with the LSO group, whereas plasma insulin concentrations were significantly decreased in the DPA group alone.

Of both the responders and non-responders, propranolol caused expected decreases in the cardiac index and heart rate while mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Of the propranolol responders, a significant decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient was observed. After the addition of clonidine, in both the responders and non-responders there was a further decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient with a concurrent drop in mean arterial pressure, but cardiac index and heart rate remained unaltered. In conclusion, the combination of propranolol and clonidine in post-hepatitic cirrhotic patients enhanced the reduction of portal pressure achieved by propranolol alone.

Among many applications, marker data are valuable for mapping complex traits through linkage or linkage-disequilibrium analysis, the former of which is the focus of this paper, the first in a series on this subject. Formalizing the concept and computation for linkage analysis, Elston and Stewart [1971; Human Heredity 21:523-542] introduced a likelihood function to capture relevant genetic information and a recursive algorithm for computing the likelihood function. However, the computing burden is prohibitive in processing complex pedigrees. Since that fundamental development, improving the computational algorithm and extending the method has been a dynamic area of research. The primary objective of this communication is to introduce a semiparametric method for linkage analysis. It is a particularly suitable approach with desirable properties for mapping complex traits that may be binary, continuous, and partially observed (i.e., censored). It incorporates candidate genes, environmental factors, and their interactions with the putative gene and is expected to be robust and efficient in comparison with likelihood-based methods.

The protein binding was marginally lower in this patient population than in healthy subjects after a single dose. The reduced binding was compatible with a reduced albumin concentration. In contrast to the situation for healthy subjects, the binding of sulfisoxazole decreased upon multiple dosing.

Here, we describe that physiological ROS are required for appropriate timing of neurogenesis in the developing telencephalon in vivo and in cultured NPCs, and that the tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in the regulation of ROS-dependent neurogenesis. p53 loss of function leads to elevated ROS and early neurogenesis, while restoration of p53 and antioxidant treatment partially reverse the phenotype associated with premature neurogenesis. Furthermore, we describe that the expression of a number of neurogenic and oxidative stress genes relies on p53 and that both p53 and ROS-dependent induction of neurogenesis depend on PI3 kinase/phospho-Akt signaling. Our results suggest that p53 fine-tunes endogenous ROS levels to ensure the appropriate timing of neurogenesis in eNPCs.

Many new technologies have been developed and applications in both fundamental and applied research have led to the development of some powerful tools for improving our knowledge of botanical systems and for gaining external influence over some of the key processes involved in inter- and intracellular organization. This is particularly the case when cell culture techniques are combined with those for the genetic modification of plant cells. Being able to regenerate whole plants that have gained or lost the expression of one or more specific genes has revolutionized the way in which we approach scientific questions and has opened up many additional possibilities for the molecular dissection of plants. The success or fall of all plant cell culture technologies lies with culture initiation. The choice of plant material, its physiologival state and cultivation history, the media used, and their means of preparation are just some of the factors that can greatly influence whether the desired end result will be achieved.

This process is controlled by diverse post-transcriptional modifications of the histone amino termini of which reversible acetylation plays a vital role. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are responsible for the addition of acetyl groups and histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyse the reverse reaction. In general, though not exclusively, histone acetylation is associated with a positive regulation of transcription, whereas histone deacetylation is correlated with transcriptional silencing. The elucidation of unequivocal links between aberrant action of HDACs and tumorigenesis lies at the base of key scientific importance of these enzymes. In particular, the potential benefit of HDAC inhibition has been confirmed in various tumour cell lines, demonstrating antiproliferative, differentiating and pro-apoptotic effects. Consequently, the dynamic quest for HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) as a new class of anticancer drugs was set off, resulting in a number of compounds that are currently evaluated in clinical trials. Ironically, the knowledge with respect to the expression pattern and function of individual HDAC isoenzymes remains largely elusive. In the present review, we provide an update of the current knowledge on the involvement of HDACs in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes in the liver, being the main site for drug metabolism within the body. Focus lies on the involvement of HDACs in the regulation of growth of normal and transformed hepatocytes and the transdifferentiation process of stellate cells. Furthermore, extrapolation of our present knowledge on HDAC functionality towards innovative treatment of malignant and non-malignant, hyperproliferative and inflammatory disorders is discussed.",J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,13,9B,2990-3005,2025-11-04 10:57:41,2025-11-04 10:57:41

Left bundle branch pacing and His bundle pacing are novel interventions that imitate the natural conduction of the heart with, theoretically, less interventricular dyssynchrony. One of the surrogate markers of interventricular synchrony is QRS duration. Our study aimed to compare the change of QRS duration before and after implantation between types of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs): left bundle branch pacing versus His bundle pacing versus biventricular pacing and conventional right ventricular pacing. A literature search for studies that reported an interval change of QRS duration after CIED implantation was conducted utilizing the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. All relevant works from database inception through November 2020 were included in this analysis. A random-effects model, Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to analyze QRS duration changes (eg, electrical cardiac synchronization) across different CIED implantations. The mean study sample size, from 14 included studies, was 185 subjects. The search found 707 articles. After exclusions, 14 articles remained with 2,054 patients. The His bundle pacing intervention resulted in the most dramatic decline in QRS duration (mean difference, - 53 ms; 95% CI - 67, - 39), followed by left bundle branch pacing (mean difference, - 46 ms; 95% CI - 60, - 33), and biventricular pacing (mean difference, - 19 ms; 95% CI - 37, - 1.8), when compared to conventional right ventricle apical pacing. When compared between LBBP and HBP, showed no statistically significant wider QRS duration in LBBP with mean different 6.5 ms. (95% CI - 6.7, 21). Our network meta-analysis found that physiologic pacing has the greatest effect on QRS duration after implantation. Thus, HBP and LBBP showed no significant difference between QRS duration after implantation.

The main objective of this research is to discover more promising anti-cancer lead compound against EGRF from the phenolic acids of marine natural products using in-silico approaches. Phenolic compounds reported from marine sources are reviewed from previous literatures. Furthermore, molecular docking was carried out using the online tool CB-Dock. The molecules with good docking and binding energies scores were subjected to ADME, toxicity and drug-likeness analysis. Subsequently, molecules from the docking experiments were also evaluated using the acute toxicity and MD simulation studies. Fourteen phenolic compounds from the reported literatures were reviewed based on the findings, isolation, characterized and applications. Molecular docking studies proved that the phenolic acids have good binding fitting by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues at the binding site of EGFR. Chlorogenic acid, Chicoric acid and Rosmarinic acid showed the best binding energies score and forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues compare to the reference drug Erlotinib. Among these compounds, Rosmarinic acid showed the good pharmacokinetics profiles as well as acute toxicity profile. The MD simulation study further revealed that the lead complex is stable and could be future drug to treat the cancer disease.

We expanded and validated serum marker indices to provide accurate, reproducible and easily applied methods of fibrosis assessment. Liver biopsy results from over 284 CHB and 2304 CHC patients in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study ('CHeCS') were mapped to a F0-F4 equivalent scale. APRI and FIB-4 scores within a 6-month window of biopsy were mapped to the same scale. A novel algorithm was applied to derive and validate optimal cut-offs for differentiating fibrosis levels.

Amyloid peptides are known to induce oxidative stress. Impairment of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) following oxidative stress, results in accumulation of toxic aldehydes, particularly 4-hydroxynoneal (4-HNE). We sought to determine the role of mitochondrial ALDH2 in Aβ-related impairment of angiogenesis. We hypothesized that by increasing the detoxification activity of ALDH2 we would reduce Aβ-driven endothelial injuries and restore angiogenesis. We used a selective ALDH2 activator, Alda-1, assessing its ability to repair mitochondrial dysfunction in the endothelium. Treatment of human endothelial cells with Aβ1-40 (5-50 µM) induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytochrome c release and ROS accumulation. These events were associated with 4-HNE accumulation and decrease in ALDH2 activity (40%), and resulted in disassembly of endothelial junctions, as evidenced by β-catenin phosphorylation, disorganization of adherens and tight junctions, and by disruption of pseudocapillary formation. Alda-1 (10-40 µM) abolished Aβ-induced 4-HNE accumulation, apoptosis and vascular leakiness, fully restoring the pro-angiogenic endothelial phenotype and responses to FGF-2. Our data document that mitochondrial ALDH2 in the endothelium is a target for the vascular effect of Aβ, including loss of barrier function and angiogenesis. ALDH2 activation, by restoring mitochondrial functions in the endothelium, prevents Aβ-induced dysfunction and anti-angiogenic effects.

Deucravacitinib, which is an oral, selective inhibitor that binds to the regulatory domain of TYK2, and brepocitinib (PF-06700841) and PF-06826647, which are topical and oral TYK2 inhibitors, respectively, that bind to the active (adenosine triphosphate-binding) site in the catalytic domain, are in development for psoriasis. Selective, allosteric inhibition of TYK2 signaling may reduce the potential for toxicities associated with pan-JAK inhibitors. This article reviews Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and TYK2 signaling and the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in psoriasis to date, focusing specifically on TYK2 inhibitors.",J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,86,1,148-157,2025-11-04 10:57:56,2025-11-04 10:57:56

SPMS patients were treated for two years with clinical evaluation (relapse rate, disability progression) every three months and radiological imaging (conventional magnetic resonance imaging) before therapy initiation and at the end of the first and second years of therapy. Safety profile and costs of the two therapeutic protocols were also analysed. In terms of clinical and radiological measures the drugs exerted a quite identical effect on both, and produced a significant reduction in both relapse rate (mitoxantrone Mito): p = 0.001, cyclophosphamide (Cy): p = 0.003) and disability progression (Mito: p = 0.01; Cy: p = 0.01). Subgroups of mitoxantrone- and cyclophosphamide-responding patients were identified (14/25 and 17/25, respectively) and were characterized by a significantly shorter duration of the secondary progressive phase of the disease. In these subgroups, the improvement in the EDSS score at the end of therapy was highly significant (p<0.0001 for Mito, p = 0.0004 for Cy). The safety profiles of both drugs were acceptable; however, the Cy-based therapy protocol was significantly less expensive. We conclude that Cy should be considered as a therapeutic option in rapidly deteriorating SPMS patients.",J Neurol,Journal of neurology,253,8,1034-40,2025-11-04 10:57:56,2025-11-04 10:57:56

Conservative medical treatment seemed to have little effect on the natural history and prevent the stroke attack caused by artery stenosis. The purpose of stent-assisted angioplasty is to reconstruct the damaged vessels: the indications, feasibility, effectiveness, complications and follow-up for this new treatment method are discussed. A series of 32 cases with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis were accepted from 1998 to 2002. The mean age was 42 yrs (31 ~ 76 yr), male/female ratio=23/9. All patients were refractory to optimal medical therapy. Lesions included 12 middle cerebral arteries (37.5%), six basilar arteries (18.75%), three distal ICAs (9.38%) and 12 intracranial Vas (37.5%). All patients were treated by methods of transluminal stent-assisted angioplasty under general anesthesia. Patients were premedicated with Aspirin (300mg/per day) and Ticlopidine (250mg/per day), this was continued for six weeks after the procedure. Medical history, anamnesis, and treatment protocol were reviewed and evaluated retrospectively, shortterm follow-up (2mths ~ 1 yr) was also obtained. Primary clinical presentations were TIAs (21/32, 65.63%), minor stroke ( 8/32, 25%) and severe stroke (3/32, 9.38%). 31 cases (96.86%) were successfully implanted with coronary stents within the stenosed vessels; technical success rate was 96.86%. Instant angiographic results showed the stenosed extent had decreased from 72.36% +/- 5.69 to 10.16% +/- 6.94. One vessel ruptured during the procedure, the patient recovered after surgical repair of the ruptured vessel. Clinical follow-up demonstrated symptoms resolved in most patients (30/32, 93.75%) within the follow- up period, two cases with MCA stenosis had TIAs within two months after the procedure. 12 cases accepted angiographic follow-up.Velocities of stented vessels of five cases (5/21, 23.81%) increased compared to instant results, suggesting restenosis, three of them were confirmed by angiography which included two cases with MCA stenosis (figure 3) and one with distal VA, one of the five cases had recurred TIAs. With the newer generation of coronary stent, this technique seemed safe, feasible and effective to prevent stroke attack, but the indication is very important for the technical success.

Recently, increasing cases of canine distemper (CD) both in vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs and in wildlife have been reported in Japan, America, Europe and Africa. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (H) gene sequences, six genotypes of CDV were distinguished. Antigenic heterogeneity of the H protein that provides an important protective antigen against CDV infection has been observed between wild-type CDV and vaccine strains. So it was suspected that the vaccines currently used can no longer efficiently protect animal from present-day circulating CDV infection. The host range of CDV includes all species of the families Canidae and many other species. Both signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) and heparin sulfate (HS) expressed on the cells of the immune system or other non-lymphoid tissues can act as the cellular receptors for CDV, and are one of the major determinants of the host range and tissue tropism.

Fusarium head blight (FHB) is considered as one of the most damaging diseases, resulting in yield and quality reduction as well as contamination of grain with mycotoxins. Three winter durum wheat cultivars originating from Austria, Slovakia, and Poland were analyzed during 2012-2014 seasons for FHB incidence and Fusarium mycotoxin accumulation in harvested grain. Moreover, the effects of sowing density and delayed sowing date were evaluated in the climatic conditions of Southern Poland. Low disease severity was observed in 2011/2012 in all durum wheat cultivars analyzed, and high FHB occurrence was recorded in 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons. Fusarium graminearum was the most abundant pathogen, followed by Fusarium avenaceum. Through all three seasons, cultivar Komnata was the most susceptible to FHB and to mycotoxin accumulation, while cultivars Auradur and IS Pentadur showed less symptoms. High susceptibility of cv. Komnata was reflected by the number of Fusarium isolates and elevated mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and moniliformin) content in the grain of this cultivar across all three seasons. Nivalenol was identified in the samples of cv. Komnata only. Genotype-dependent differences in FHB susceptibility were observed for the plants sown at optimal date but not at delayed sowing date. It can be hypothesized that cultivars bred in Austria and Slovakia show less susceptibility towards FHB than the cultivar from Poland because of the environmental conditions allowing for more efficient selection of breeding materials.",Naturwissenschaften,Die Naturwissenschaften,105,1-2,2,2025-11-04 10:58:11,2025-11-04 10:58:11

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) were subjected to two groups randomly; sham-treated (N = 10) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated (N = 10) (E. coli LPS 2 mg/kg bolus + 2 mg/kg infusion for 30 min). The animals in each group were further subdivided into vehicle and MEPD inhibitor phosphoramidon (1 mg/kg bolus, PHOS)-treated groups. LPS produces a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 2 h post endotoxemia that was blocked by PHOS. PHOS attenuated LPS-induced increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentration at 2- and 24 h post-LPS administration. LPS significantly elevated plasma concentrations of ET-1 at 2- and 24 h post endotoxemia. An upregulated preproET-1 expression following both LPS and MEPD inhibition was observed in thoracic aorta at 2 h post treatment. PHOS effectively blocked conversion of preproET-1 to ET-1 in thoracic aorta locally at 24 h post treatment in endotoxic rats. PHOS inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of inducible NOS (iNOS), downregulation of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and elevation of NO byproducts (NOx) in thoracic aorta. PHOS also blocked LPS-induced upregulated p38-MAPK phosphorylation in thoracic aorta at 24 h post endotoxemia. The data revealed that LPS induces MEPD-sensitive inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at 2- and 24 h post endotoxemia. We concluded that inhibition of MEPD not only decreases the levels of ET-1 but also simultaneously downregulates protein expression of iNOS and phosphorylated p38-MAPK while increasing eNOS in thoracic aorta during SIRS in endotoxemia. We suggest that MEPD-dependent ET-1 and NO mechanisms may be involved in endotoxemia-induced altered p38-MAPK phosphorylation.",Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,265,1-2,47-56,2025-11-04 10:58:12,2025-11-04 10:58:12

This study aims to describe urologists' attitudes regarding information sharing with prostate cancer patients and to compare these findings with the previously published attitudes of Israeli family physicians. A questionnaire (11 items) was mailed to 87 board-certified practicing urologists. Fifty-four physicians (66%) completed the questionnaires. Sixty-one percent of respondents stated that patients should be told the complete truth about their disease. Ninety-six percent of respondents felt competent at breaking bad news and stated they would discuss emotions with patients. The majority of physicians would provide general information when referring for a medical procedure, discussing treatment options or a patient's prognosis.

9679555,"K D Tew, M O'Brien, N M Laing, H Shen",1998,Coordinate changes in expression of protective genes in drug-resistant cells.,"Maintenance of cellular homeostasis is a critical survival trait when cells are exposed to electrophilic chemicals. Because conjugation and elimination of these toxins is dependent upon sequential and coordinated metabolic pathways, acquired resistance through a gradual adaptive response would rarely be expected to be the consequence of changes in one gene product. Human HT29 colon cancer cells chronically exposed to EA have acquired resistance to the drug. Commensurate with resistance, EA is more effectively conjugated to GSH and effluxed from the resistant cells. Using directed and random (differential display) approaches, a number of detoxification and/or protective gene products have been shown to be expressed at elevated levels. These include gamma-GCS (approximately 3-fold), GST-pi (approximately 3-fold), MRP (approximately 3-fold), NQO1 (approximately 3-fold), DDH (20-fold), and SSP 3521, a transcriptional regulator (approximately 3-fold). Multiple mechanisms contribute to these increases, including enhanced transcriptional rate and prolonged mRNA and protein half lives. Further indications for the involvement of transcriptional regulators is found in HL60 adriamycin-resistant cells which overexpress MRP, GST-pi and gamma-GCS and also have 15-20-fold more DNA-dependent protein kinase. It is possible that this enzyme serves as an early stress response gene which may activate downstream transcription factors. Intriguingly, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase has a high avidity for [35S]azidophenacyl-GSH. High levels of GSH conjugates indicate cell stress and it would seem reasonable to speculate that DNA-dependent protein kinase may serve as a receiver and transmitter of signals which contribute to drug resistance and maintain cell viability.",Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,111-112,N/A,199-211,2025-11-04 10:58:13,2025-11-04 10:58:13

All the non-Drosophilidae sequences in this region are short and present a remarkably stable picture compared to the Drosophilidae, in which the region is much larger and extremely variable, both in size and composition. The accelerated evolution in the repetitive region of the Drosophilidae appears to be mainly due to an expansion of two ancestral repeats, one encoding a Thr-Gly dipeptide and the other a pentapeptide rich in serine, glycine, and asparagine or threonine. In some drosophilids the expansion involves a duplication of the pentapeptide sequence, but in Drosophila pseudoobscura both the dipeptide and the pentapeptide repeats are present in larger numbers. In the nondrosophilids, however, the pentapeptide sequence is represented by one copy and the dipeptide by two copies. These observations fulfill some of the predictions of recent theoretical models that have simulated the evolution of repetitive sequences.",Mol Biol Evol,Molecular biology and evolution,11,6,839-53,2025-11-04 10:58:16,2025-11-04 10:58:16

In the model, the population of neurons which were selective to the logarithmic number of signals responded to sequential signals and the population activity was integrated by a temporal window. The total number of signals was decoded by a weighted average of the integrated activity. The model predicted well the general trends in the human data while the prediction was not fully sufficient for the novel aging effect wherein underestimation was significantly greater for the elderly than for the young in specific stimulus conditions.

K-means cluster analysis was used to group 3001 adults from the KORA F4 cohort into three clusters. We identified the clustering parameters through variable importance methods, without including any specific disease endpoint. Several unique combinations of selected parameters were used to create different metabotype models. Metabotype models were then described and evaluated, based on various metabolic parameters and on the incidence of cardiometabolic diseases. As a result, two optimal models were identified: a model composed of five parameters, which were fasting glucose, HDLc, non-HDLc, uric acid, and BMI (the metabolic disease model) for clustering; and a model that included four parameters, which were fasting glucose, HDLc, non-HDLc, and triglycerides (the cardiovascular disease model). These identified metabotypes are based on a few common parameters that are measured in everyday clinical practice.

The spectra demonstrate, within the limits of the triple quadrupole's resolving power, that high-energy EID product-ion spectra produced with an EMS cell exhibit essentially the same qualitative structural information, i.e., amino acid side-chain (SC) losses and backbone cleavages, as observed in high-energy EID spectra produced with a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer.

We explored this further in 4,246 men aged 45-69, who were found to be free of major CHD when screened for a primary prevention trial of antithrombotic medication. All men were asked about their consumption of fatty foods and changes in consumption in the last month. In the 9% of men who reported avoidance of fatty foods in the month before interview, age adjusted VIIc was 7.8% of standard (95% CI 5.1-10.6%) lower than in the remainder. Serum cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) were also significantly lower. The extent to which fat consumed in the past month had deviated from usual intake was significantly and positively related with VIIc, serum cholesterol and BMI. Thus, the VIIc difference between those eating much less fatty food than usual and those eating much more than usual was 11% of standard, with those eating their usual amount having an intermediate level. This study adds to the evidence that dietary fat intake influences VIIc and coagulability. The effect is rapid, so that much of the benefit of dietary fat reduction on thrombogenic risk in CHD is likely to occur within a short time.

It has been shown to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, ranging from the maintenance of genomic integrity and hence, oncogenesis, to a role in development. Recent identification of direct and indirect RNF4 targets has revealed that the SUMOylation machinery is in itself targeted by RNF4, highlighting the complex nature of the signaling circuitry tightly regulating these processes. This review will touch upon both SUMOylation and ubiquitination, and will focus on how RNF4, which is at the heart of both these PTMs, modulates cellular signaling and promotes protein degradation. Moreover, the potential of therapeutically targeting RNF4 to improve cancer treatment is also explored.",Proteomics,Proteomics,19,21-22,e1900185,2025-11-04 10:58:42,2025-11-04 10:58:42

The tissue section containing the most luminal portion of suture loop was chosen and submitted for analysis. Two parameters, one estimating the suture location in the vessel wall relative to the internal elastic lamina (IEL) and a second, estimating the magnitude of the intimal response at the suture site were addressed. Average suture location changed significantly over time. The suture tended to be exteriorized or extruded from its once luminal location within the intima to a position located within the adventitia. Veins exhibited a greater incidence of suture extrusion than arteries. The maximum magnitude of the intimal cellular response occurred in the 2 week time interval. Significant decreases (p less than 0.05) in the thickness of the intima was observed in each subsequent time interval for both arteries and veins. The results of this experiment indicate that the cellular response and reparative processes occurring in small arteries and veins modifies the luminal papillary projection and extrudes nylon suture material.",Scand J Plast Reconstr Surg Hand Surg,Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,22,2,121-6,2025-11-04 10:58:46,2025-11-04 10:58:46

All ponies became depressed (CNS) at various times during the disease, and 90% of the ponies developed diarrhea between 9 and 15 days after infection was induced. The most significant hematologic change was an increase in plasma protein concentration after the onset of fever (P less than 0.05). The PCV in all ponies became increased above base line during the diarrheic phase of EEC. Forty percent of the ponies developed anemia (PCV less than or equal to 23%) during the study.

However, it is still not clear whether cells can recognize individual CNTs with a sub-2 nm diameter, and directional nanostructured substrates such as aligned CNT networks have not been utilized to control cell behaviors. Herein, we report that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) grown on CNT networks could recognize the arrangement of individual CNTs in the CNT networks, which allowed us to control the growth direction and differentiation of the hMSCs. We achieved the directional growth of hMSCs following the alignment direction of the individual CNTs. Furthermore, hMSCs on aligned CNT networks exhibited enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation compared to those on randomly oriented CNT networks. As a plausible explanation for the enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, we proposed mechanotransduction pathways triggered by high cytoskeletal tension in the aligned hMSCs.

Whereas this is undeniably positive for patients, aging is related to natural decline in cognitive functions. As patients with T1DM across the life-span are susceptible to cognitive deterioration, an interaction with aging may be expected and the risk of development of dementia might be increased. As achieving glycemic control depends on a set of diabetes self-management behaviors, it is imperative to understand how cognitive functions are involved in the upkeep of these behaviors and how cognitive impairment may affect them. In this narrative review, we set out to understand the relationship between cognition and T1DM self-care by first reviewing the glycemic targets in older adults, what treatment options are available, and what cognitive functions they draw upon.

17680687,"Michal Brylinski, Jeffrey Skolnick",2008,What is the relationship between the global structures of apo and holo proteins?,"It is well known that ligand binding and release may induce a wide range of structural changes in a receptor protein, varying from small movements of loops or side chains in the binding pocket to large-scale domain hinge-bending and shear motions or even partial unfolding that facilitates the capture and release of a ligand. An interesting question is what in general are the conformational changes triggered by ligand binding? The aim of this work is analyze the magnitude of structural changes in a protein resulting from ligand binding to assess if the state of ligand binding needs to be included in template-based protein structure prediction algorithms. To address this issue, a nonredundant dataset of 521 paired protein structures in the ligand-free and ligand-bound form was created and used to estimate the degree of both local and global structure similarity between the apo and holo forms. In most cases, the proteins undergo relatively small conformational rearrangements of their tertiary structure upon ligand binding/release (most root-mean-square-deviations from native, RMSD, are <1 A). However, a clear difference was observed between single- and multiple-domain proteins. For the latter, RMSD changes greater than 1 A and sometimes larger were found for almost 1/3 of the cases; these are mainly associated with large-scale hinge-bending movements of entire domains. The changes in the mutual orientation of individual domains in multiple-domain proteins upon ligand binding were investigated using a mechanistic model based on mass-weighted principal axes as well as interface buried surface calculations.

The animals passed 4 sessions: one control, one with the solvent injection, and two with the administration of CZP (either 0.1 or 1 mg/kg i.p.). The ADs were always induced 4 times with 20 min intervals, the injections took place 10 min before the second stimulation. The EEG pattern of ADs was not changed by either dose of CZP and the duration was transiently shortened by the high dose only. Incidence of recurrent ADs tended to decrease after the lower dose of CZP, the higher dose blocked them for at least 30 min. As concerns behavioral concomitants of ADs, wet dog shakes remained uninfluenced by CZP while orienting reaction was either fully blocked (by the high dose of CZP) or significantly suppressed (by the lower dose).",Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther,Archives internationales de pharmacodynamie et de therapie,299,N/A,35-43,2025-11-04 10:59:07,2025-11-04 10:59:07

External resistors in parallel and series are added to vary the extent of global coupling among the oscillators without changing the other properties of the system. The array is heterogeneous due to small variations in the properties of the electrodes and there is also a small amount of noise. The addition of global coupling transforms a system of independent elements to a state of complete synchronization. At intermediate coupling strengths stable clusters, or condensates of elements, form. All the elements in a cluster follow the same chaotic trajectory but each cluster has its own dynamics; the system is thus temporally chaotic but spatially ordered. Many cluster configurations occur under the same conditions and transitions among them can be produced. For values of the coupling parameter on either side of the stable cluster region a non-stationary behavior occurs in which clustered and synchronized states alternately form and break up. Some statistical properties of the cluster states are determined. (c) 2000 American Institute of Physics.",Chaos,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",10,1,248-256,2025-11-04 10:59:08,2025-11-04 10:59:08

This motivated a structure aided fragment based lead generation campaign to create novel FXIa inhibitor leads. A virtual screen, based on docking experiments, was performed to generate a FXIa targeted fragment library for an NMR screen that resulted in the identification of fragments binding in the FXIa S1 binding pocket. The neutral 6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinolin-2-one and the weakly basic quinolin-2-amine structures are novel FXIa P1 fragments. The expansion of these fragments towards the FXIa prime side binding sites was aided by solving the X-ray structures of reported FXIa inhibitors that we found to bind in the S1-S1'-S2' FXIa binding pockets. Combining the X-ray structure information from the identified S1 binding 6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinolin-2-one fragment and the S1-S1'-S2' binding reference compounds enabled structure guided linking and expansion work to achieve one of the most potent and selective FXIa inhibitors reported to date, compound 13, with a FXIa IC50 of 1.0 nM. The hydrophilicity and large polar surface area of the potent S1-S1'-S2' binding FXIa inhibitors compromised permeability.

While hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia have not definitely been associated with increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis in parrots, these are important and well-known risk factors in humans. Therefore statin drugs such as rosuvastatin constitute the mainstay of human treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of atherosclerosis. No pharmacologic studies have been performed in psittacine birds despite the high prevalence of atherosclerosis in captivity. Thirteen Hispaniolan Amazon parrots were used to test a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of rosuvastatin with blood sampling performed according to a balanced incomplete block design over 36 hours. Because low plasma concentrations were produced in the first study, a subsequent pilot study using a dose of 25 mg/kg in 2 Amazon parrots was performed. Most plasma samples for the 10 mg/kg dose and all samples for the 25 mg/kg dose had rosuvastatin concentration below the limits of quantitation. For the 10 mg/kg study, the median peak plasma concentration and time to peak plasma concentration were 0.032 μg/mL and 2 hours, respectively. Our results indicate that rosuvastatin does not appear suitable in Amazon parrots as compounded and used at the dose in this study.

It is known that norepinephrine (NE) can be significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortex under normal conditions such as arousal and attention, and following the administration of psychostimulants and various other drugs prescribed for psychiatric disorders. However, how NE modulates neuronal activity and synapses in the local prefrontal circuitry remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the actions of NE on individual monosynaptic connections among layer V pyramidal neurons (P) and fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons in the juvenile (postnatal days 20-23) rat prefrontal local circuitry. We found that NE selectively depresses excitatory synaptic transmission in P-FS connections but has no detectable effect on the excitatory synapses in P-P connections and the inhibitory synapses in FS-P connections. NE apparently exerts distinctly different modulatory actions on identified synapses that target GABAergic interneurons but has no effect on those in the pyramidal neurons in this specific developmental period.

Here, we show surface plasmon-induced catalytic enhancement by the peculiar nanocatalyst design of hexoctahedral (HOH) Au nanocrystals (NCs) with Cu2O clusters. We found that this inverse catalyst comprising a reactive oxide for the catalytic portion and a metal as the source of electrons by localized surface plasmon resonance (localized SPR) exhibits a change in catalytic activity by direct hot electron transfer or plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) when exposed to light. We prepared two types of inverse catalysts, Cu2O at the vertex sites of HOH Au NCs (Cu2O/Au vertex site) and a HOH Au NC-Cu2O core-shell structure (HOH Au@Cu2O), to test the structural effect on surface plasmons. Under broadband light illumination, the Cu2O/Au vertex site catalyst showed 30-90% higher catalytic activity and the HOH Au@Cu2O catalyst showed 10-30% higher catalytic activity than when in the dark. Embedding thin SiO2 layers between the HOH Au NCs and the Cu2O verified that the dominant mechanism for the catalytic enhancement is direct hot electron transfer from the HOH Au to the Cu2O. Finite-difference time domain calculations show that a much stronger electric field was formed on the vertex sites after growing the Cu2O on the HOH Au NCs. These results imply that the catalytic activity is enhanced when hot electrons, created from photon absorption on the HOH Au metal and amplified by the presence of surface plasmons, are transferred to the reactive Cu2O.",Nanoscale,Nanoscale,10,23,10835-10843,2025-11-04 10:59:19,2025-11-04 10:59:19

However, there are no published data available for tibialis posterior - a muscle that plays an important role in controlling foot motion. The purpose of this study was to characterise the electromyographic timing and amplitude of selected lower limb muscles across five walking speeds. Thirty young adults were instructed to walk barefoot while electromyographic activity was recorded from tibialis posterior and peroneus longus via intramuscular electrodes, and medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior via surface electrodes. At faster walking speeds, peak electromyographic amplitude increased systematically during the contact and midstance/propulsion phases. Changes in the time of peak amplitude were also observed for tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus activity; however, these were muscle and phase specific. During contact phase, peak electromyographic amplitude for tibialis posterior and peroneus longus was similar across very slow to slow walking speeds. During midstance/propulsion phase, peak electromyographic amplitude for tibialis posterior and medial gastrocnemius was similar across very slow to slow walking speeds. These findings may reflect a relatively higher than expected demand for peroneus longus and tibialis posterior to assist with medio-lateral foot stability at very slow speeds. Similarly, peak amplitude of medial gastrocnemius was also relatively unchanged at the very slow speed, presumably to compensate for the reduced forward momentum.

The glutamate-dependent (GAD) system plays a major role in acid resistance in Escherichia coli, and expression of the GAD system is controlled by the regulatory cascade consisting of EvgAS > YdeO > GadE. To understand the YdeO regulon in vivo, we used ChIP-chip to interrogate the E. coli genome for candidate YdeO binding sites. All of the seven operons identified by ChIP-chip as being potentially regulated by YdeO were confirmed as being under the direct control of YdeO using RT-qPCR, EMSA, DNaseI-footprinting and reporter assays. Within this YdeO regulon, we identified four stress-response transcription factors, DctR, NhaR, GadE, and GadW and enzymes for anaerobic respiration. Both GadE and GadW are involved in regulation of the GAD system and NhaR is an activator for the sodium/proton antiporter gene. In conjunction with co-transcribed Slp, DctR is involved in protection against metabolic endoproducts under acidic conditions. Taken all together, we suggest that YdeO is a key regulator of E. coli survival in both acidic and anaerobic conditions.",PLoS One,PloS one,9,11,e111962,2025-11-04 10:59:29,2025-11-04 10:59:29

The cell surface is in a state of isotropic contraction, which causes the cell to assume a spherical shape. This contraction is characterized by the cortical tension. The cortical tension shows a weak area dilation dependence, and it determines the elastic properties of the cell for small curvature deformations. At high curvature deformations in small pipets (with internal radii less than 1 micron), the measured critical suction pressure for cell flow into the pipet is larger than its estimate from the law of Laplace. A model is proposed where the region consisting of the cytoplasm membrane and the underlying cortex (having a finite thickness) is introduced at the cell surface. The mechanical properties of this region are characterized by the apparent cortical tension (defined as a free contraction energy per unit area) and the apparent bending modulus (introduced as a bending free energy per unit area) of its middle plane. The model predicts that for small curvature deformations (in pipets having radii larger than 1.2 microns) the role of the cortical thickness and the resistance for bending of the membrane-cortex complex is negligible. For high curvature deformations, they lead to elevated suction pressures above the values predicted from the law of Laplace. The existence of elevated suction pressures for pipets with radii from 1 micron down to 0.24 micron is found experimentally. The measured excess suction pressures cannot be explained only by the modified law of Laplace (for a cortex with finite thickness and negligible bending resistance), because it predicts unacceptable high cortical thicknesses (from 0.3 to 0.7 micron). It is concluded that the membrane-cortex complex has an apparent bending modulus from 1 x 10(-18) to 2 x 10(-18) J for a cortex with a thickness from 0.1 micron down to values much smaller than the radius of the smallest pipet (0.24 micron) used in this study.",Biophys J,Biophysical journal,67,2,696-705,2025-11-04 10:59:31,2025-11-04 10:59:31

To clarify the relationship between the substrate-binding pocket and end-product distribution, the open binding pocket change was initially designed. The resulting F128T_W172R mutant of AlyF exhibited different intermediate-product distributions but still similar end-product distributions. However, these observations suggested that cleavage pattern changes for intermediate products might contribute to an altered end-product distribution. Structural analysis indicated that the sugar-binding affinity at subsite -2 should be redesigned to achieve this goal. Thus, residue Arg266, which is involved in sugar binding at subsite -2, was selected for site-saturation mutagenesis in the F128T_W172R mutant.

The tiny size, variable surface topography, thermal properties, bioavailability and biological toxicity of microplastics all offer opportunities for these pollutants to negatively impact the environment. Additionally, various inorganic and organic chemicals sorbed on these particles may pose a greater threat to organisms than the microplastics themselves. However, there is still a big knowledge gap in the assessment of various toxicological effects of microplastics in the environment. Ecological risk assessment of microplastics has become more challenging with the current data gaps. Thus, a current literature review and identification of the areas where research on ecology of microplastics can be extended is necessary. We have provided an overview of various aspects of microplastics by which they interact negatively or positively with marine organisms. We hypothesize that biogeochemical interactions are critical to fully understand the ecological impacts, movement, and fate of microplastics in oceans. As microplastics are now ubiquitous in marine environments and impossible to remove, we recommend that it's not too late to converge research on plastic alternatives.

In Japan, a nation-wide neuroblastoma mass-screening (MS) project assessed 6-month-old infants between 1985 and 2003, and almost all neuroblastomas, including regressing or maturing tumors were thought to be detected in this period. To evaluate the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma subgroups, we analyzed patients with neuroblastoma who had been diagnosed during this period. The clinical courses of 4,209 patients with neuroblastoma, including 1,560 MS detected patients, whose tumors had been diagnosed between 1971 and 1995 were registered. The 2,520 cases registered between 1985 and 1995 were compared to 1,050 cases registered between 1971 and 1980 and analyzed by a multi-gene target model to determine the age distribution of neuroblastoma incidence. We hypothesized that three target genes were responsible for the progression of neuroblastoma: one pair of tumor suppressor gene alleles, one oncogene, and one gene controlling regression/differentiation. This simulation study revealed that the age distribution at initial diagnosis of neuroblastoma was divided into four groups based on post-fertilization age: 20-40, 40-50, 60-90, and 160-200 weeks. Since neuroblatoma in the first group occurred prenatal, post-natal clinical neuroblastoma can be classified into three age groups: 0-6 months, 1-2 years, and 3-4 years. The 0- to 6-month group consisted of mostly benign tumors, and the two older groups had predominantly malignant phenotypes. Our proposed model could explain qualitatively the distribution of neuroblastoma consisting of one subgroup with a favorable prognosis and two subgroups with unfavorable prognosis.

However, complete sealing of the landfill only temporarily reduces emissions because dry-conservation of the biodegradable waste fraction results, thus not allowing any severe reduction in the emission and hazardous potential of the landfill to occur. If noticeable damage of the surface capping system occurred in these landfills, infiltrating water would restart the interrupted emission formation. In contrast, aerobic in situ stabilization by means of low pressure aeration attempts to stabilize and modify the inventory of organic matter inside the landfill, acting to reduce the emission potential in a more sustainable manner. By enabling faster and more extensive aerobic degradation processes in the landfill (compared with anaerobic processes), the organics (e.g., hydrocarbons) are degraded significantly faster, resulting in an increased carbon discharge via the gas phase, as well as reduced leachate concentrations. Because carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is the main compound in the extracted off-gas (instead of methane (CH(4)), which dominated under anaerobic landfill conditions), the negative impact of diffuse LFG emissions towards an increased global warming effect may be significantly lowered. With respect to leachate quality, a reduction of organic compounds as well as ammonia-nitrogen can be expected. In addition to these positive ecological effects, aerobic in situ stabilization is associated with significant cost savings potential due to both quantitative and qualitative reductions in the aftercare period. This paper describes the fundamental processes and implications of in situ landfill aeration. Additionally, possible criteria for defining an endpoint of the active aeration process are presented and discussed.",Waste Manag,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",26,4,356-72,2025-11-04 10:59:43,2025-11-04 10:59:43

They report the case of a 35-year-old woman with Marfucci syndrome (diagnosed when she was 22 years old) who presented with complaints of decreased visual acuity and visual field defect. Neuroimaging revealed a pituitary macroadenoma and a suspected brainstem tumor. The macroadenoma was partially removed. There were no postoperative complications and the patient experienced rapid improvement in visual acuity. On follow-up examination 2 years later, the lesion in the pons showed the same dimensions. No sarcomatous changes of enchondromas or hemangiomas occurred. To the authors' knowledge, including the present case, only 7 cases of Maffucci syndrome associated with glioma and 7 cases associated with pituitary adenoma have been reported in the literature.

Engineering is limited because PON1's catalytic mechanism is poorly understood; moreover, its native activity and substrate are unknown. PON1 is a calcium-bound six-bladed β-propeller hydrolase that shares high structural homology, a conserved metal-coordinating active site, and substrate specificity overlap with other members of a superfamily that includes squid diisopropylfluorophosphatase, bacterial drug responsive protein 35, and mammalian senescence marker protein 30. We hypothesized that, by examining the reactivity of all four hydrolases using a common set of conservative mutations, we could gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of PON1. We chose a set of mutations to examine conserved Asp and Glu residues in the hydrolase active sites and the ligation sphere around the catalytic calcium and a His-His dyad seen in PON1.

However, it is unknown whether it is involved in the response to hypoxia and glucocorticoid (GC) in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). In this study we found that hypoxia and dexamethasone (dex), a synthetic GC not only up-regulated the expression of stomatin alone, but also imposed additive effect on the expression of stomatin in A549 cells, primary AEC and lung of rats. Then we investigated whether hypoxia and dex transcriptionally up-regulated the expression of stomatin by reporter gene assay, and found that dex, but not hypoxia could increase the activity of a stomatin promoter-driven reporter gene. Further deletion and mutational studies demonstrated that a GC response element (GRE) within the promoter region mainly contributed to the induction of stomatin by dex. Moreover, we found that hypoxia exposure did not affect membrane-associated actin, but decreased actin in cytoplasm in A549 cells. Inhibiting stomatin expression by stomatin siRNA significantly decreased dense of peripheral actin ring in hypoxia or dex treated A549 cells. Taken all together, these data indicated that dex and/or hypoxia significantly up-regulated the expression of stomatin in vivo and in vitro, which could stabilize membrane-associated actin in AEC. We suppose that the up-regulation of stomatin by hypoxia and dex may enhance the barrier function of alveolar epithelia and mediate the adaptive role of GC to hypoxia.",J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,17,7,863-72,2025-11-04 10:59:47,2025-11-04 10:59:47

Analytical subfractionation of a postmitochondrial supernatant fraction showed that a pulse of internalized [(125)I]EGF was largely associated with a light endosomal fraction devoid of lysosomal markers. After an additional 30 min incubation in vitro in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, the amount of [(125)I]EGF in this compartment decreased by 39%, with an increase in [(125)I]EGF in lysosomes. No transfer of [(125)I]EGF to the cytosol was detected. To assess the fate of the internalized EGFR protein over the time course of the endo-lysosomal transfer of the ligand, the effect of a saturating dose of native EGF on subsequent lysosomal targeting of the EGFR was evaluated by immunoblotting. A massive translocation of the EGFR to the endosomal compartment was observed in response to ligand injection coincident with its tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor recruitment of the tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor protein Shc. During cell-free endosome-lysosome fusion, a time-dependent increase in the content of the EGFR and the two 55- and 46-kDa Shc isoforms was observed in lysosomal fractions with a time course superimposable with the lysosomal transfer of the ligand; no transfer of the 66-kDa Shc isoform was detected. The relationship between EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and EGFR sorting in endosomes investigated by immunoblot studies with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that endosomal dephosphorylation of EGFR and Shc preceded lysosomal transfer. These results support the view that a lysosomal targeting machinery distinct from the endosomal receptor kinase activity, such as the recruitment of the signaling molecule Shc, may regulate this sorting event in the endosome.",FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,461,1-2,25-31,2025-11-04 10:59:49,2025-11-04 10:59:49

However, when a hydroxyl or amine group is attached to the 2 or 4 position relative to chlorine, a surprisingly facile and selective hydrodehalogenation occurs at temperatures between 530 and 630 K. These features are the result of the onset of tautomeric equilibria for the chlorophenols or -anilines, creating the corresponding enones or imines, respectively, as reactive intermediates. The mechanism of dehalogenation involves the rate-determining transfer of a hydrogen atom from the solvent to the reactive intermediate according to a reverse radical disproportionation (RRD), followed by elimination of chlorine.

During development, beta-galactosidase activity was seen in all epithelial cells: strong staining was observed in the stomach and kidney epithelium, the ependymal layer of the central nervous system, and the surface ectoderm. Particularly prominent beta-galactosidase activity was seen in the peripheral nervous system, which correlated with neurite outgrowth. In epithelial cells, staining was seen in the apical portion of the cells. In nerves, beta-galactosidase activity was associated with growth cones as well as with Schwann cells. This suggests that the amino-terminal portion of PTP-BL contains sequences sufficient to target the fusion protein to specific subcellular compartments. In situ hybridization with a PTP-BL probe demonstrated that all tissues in which beta-galactosidase activity was seen were genuine sites of expression of the PTP-BL gene, although differences in the stability of the PTP-BL protein and the PTP-BL-beta-galactosidase fusion protein may exist. The distribution of beta-galactosidase activity in the peripheral nervous system, together with the structure of the wild-type protein, suggests that this phosphatase may have a role in regulation of the cytoskeleton during the development of the peripheral nervous system.",Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,212,2,250-7,2025-11-04 11:00:00,2025-11-04 11:00:00

We have attempted to determine whether aldosterone induces the synthesis of specific protein(s) in the course of its action upon the toad urinary bladder. Paired hemibladders were incubated in media containing either [3H]methionine or [35S]methionine; aldosterone in physiologic concentrations was added to one bath and, after incubation, the intact ""mitochondria-rich"" (MR) and ""granular"" (G) mucosal cells were isolated. The ratio (3H/35S) was used to identify proteins whose synthesis was induced in the mucosal cells of the steroid-treated bladders. Using exclusion gel chromatography and isoelectric focusing, we identified several aldosterone-induced proteins in the supernatant (105,000 x g) fraction of the MR cell. None was evident in this fraction of the G cell. These proteins have apparent molecular weights ranging from 17,000 to 38,000 and the isoelectric point of the major component is 4.5. Corticosterone (11beta,21-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione) induced the synthesis of proteins in the G cells, but none of these proteins was similar in molecular weight to the aldosterone-induced proteins in the MR cell.

The lipid content increased with decreasing temperature in the liver of both species, suggesting enhanced lipid storage under cold conditions. In P. brachycephalum, lipid composition in the liver and muscle was strongly dominated by triacylglycerols between 0 and 6 degrees C. In contrast, in the temperate species, lipid class composition changed with changes in the temperature. When acclimatized to 4 and 6 degrees C Z. viviparus not only displayed a shift to lipid anabolism and pronounced lipid storage, as indicated by high triacylglycerol levels, but also a shift to patterns of cold adaptation, as reflected by an increased content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the lipid extract. Unsaturated fatty acids were also abundant in the Antarctic eelpout, but when compared to Z. viviparus at the same temperatures, the latter had significantly higher ratios of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid levels, whereas the Antarctic eelpout showed significantly higher ratios of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid levels. High delta-15N values of the Antarctic eelpout reflect the high trophic level of this scavenger in the Weddell Sea food web. Stable carbon values suggest that lipid-enriched prey forms a major part of its diet. The strategy to accumulate storage lipids in the cold is interpreted to be adaptive behaviour at colder temperatures and during periods of irregular, pulsed food supply.",Fish Physiol Biochem,Fish physiology and biochemistry,34,3,261-74,2025-11-04 11:00:03,2025-11-04 11:00:03

The initial management for GDM includes intensive lifestyle modification, which often requires behavioral and nutritional changes to optimize glycemic control. Pharmacotherapy for GDM is initiated when glycemic targets are not met. The rapid-acting bolus analogues aspart and lispro achieve postprandial targets with less hypoglycemia compared to regular insulin, with similar fetal outcomes. The long-acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir appear safe with similar maternal/fetal outcomes compared to NPH. While insulin has been the mainstay therapy for women with GDM to improve glycemic control when lifestyle modifications are insufficient, certain oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs) can be considered as alternative treatment options for GDM but continue to be controversial for use as first-line treatment options compared to insulin by many professional bodies. Metformin has good efficacy and short-term safety data but it freely crosses the placenta and long-term safety data are lacking.

Empirical evidence relating to the TVGC test suggests the existence of unidirectional Granger causality between crude oil futures and agricultural product futures. This relationship shows a strong time-varying property, in particular for sudden or extreme events such as financial crises and natural disasters. On the other hand, the volatility spillover in crude oil and agricultural product futures markets responds asymmetrically and bidirectionally according to the result of the DY Spillover index, and the periodicity of total volatility spillover correlates closely with the occurrence of global economic events, which indicates that the spillover effect between crude oil and agricultural commodity futures markets will be exacerbated in turbulent financial and economic times.

Survivors were determined using tryptic soy agar with 0.1% pyruvate (TSAP) and PALCAM agar. Results showed that surviving bacterial populations on TWTM, AATM, and MM treatments were significantly (P<0.05) lower than those surviving on C and TM until 42 days of storage. By the end of 60 days of storage, bacterial populations in all treatments were not different regardless of acid adaptation or recovery media, except for treatment C inoculated with nonadapted cultures, which had significantly higher TSAP counts than other treatments. There was no significant (P> or =0.05) difference in survival of previously acid-adapted and nonadapted bacterial populations in samples of TWTM, AATM, and MM treatments. However, bacterial populations that were nonadapted were significantly higher than those that were acid-adapted on products of C and TM treatments on days 60 and 24, respectively.

Intraoperative laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography (LA-ICGA) was performed on 20 skin sparing mastectomy flaps. LA-ICGA data were retrospectively compared with clinical outcome. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative digital photographs along with clinical course were evaluated in an effort to identify potential complications. LA-ICGA was performed on 20 breasts in 12 patients. Eleven breasts (55%) demonstrated no wound-healing issues. Nine breasts (45%) experienced wound-healing issues, which were stratified as follows: 1 (5%) mild, 1 (5%) moderate, and 7 (35%) severe. Of these seven severe wound-healing issues, 5 (25%) required debridement and 2 (10%) required complete removal of the prosthetic device. Retrospective analysis demonstrated a 95% correlation between intraoperative imaging and clinical course with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. There was a false-positive rate of 9%.

28522598,"Ron N Apte, Elena Voronov",2017,Immunotherapeutic approaches of IL-1 neutralization in the tumor microenvironment.,"IL-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that controls inflammation, immunity, and hemopoiesis. The major IL-1 agonistic molecules are IL-1α and IL-1β, which bind to IL-1R type I (IL-1R1) and induce similar biologic functions. The IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a physiologic inhibitor of IL-1R1 signaling. In the tumor microenvironment, IL-1 is expressed by malignant, stromal, and infiltrating cells and supports tumor invasiveness and progression. We have shown that in the tumor microenvironment, the IL-1 agonistic molecules act different as a result of their local amounts and their compartmentalization within the producing cells. IL-1β is produced mainly by myeloid cells upon inflammatory stimulation and is active as a mature, secreted molecule. The precursor of IL-1α (ProIL-1α) is biologically active; it is constitutively expressed in diverse tissue cells in basal levels, and its expression increases during stress or inflammation. ProIL-1α is mainly located in the cytosol or it is membrane associated. ProIL-1α also translocates into the nucleus and binds to chromatin. ProIL-1α is rarely actively secreted but is released from necrotizing tissues and serves as ""alarmin"" for initiation of inflammation. In the tumor microenvironment, IL-1β promotes tumorigenesis, tumor invasiveness, and immunosuppression. On the other hand, membrane-associated forms of IL-1α support the development of anti-tumor immunity. In cancer patients, both IL-1 agonistic molecules coexist and interact with each other. Here, we discuss the role of IL-1 agonistic molecules in tumor progression and their potential to serve as targets in anti-tumor immunotherapeutic approaches. Our notion on the optimal conditions for IL-1 manipulation is also discussed.",J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,102,2,293-306,2025-11-04 11:00:28,2025-11-04 11:00:28

A monoclonal antibody (mAb, N9-127) was then raised from spleen cells of a B6 mouse immunized syngenically against one of these CTL clones. This mAb detected the epitope (127Ep) of the T cell antigen receptor (TcR) on the immunizing CTL clone in tests of immunoprecipitation, specific blocking and proliferation, and induction of TcR-mediated nonspecific lysis of the clone. In addition, more than 10% of the FBL-3-specific CTL clones isolated independently from B6 mice were 127Ep+. Further investigations revealed that up to 30% of B6 anti-FBL-3 T cell blasts from mixed lymphocyte tumor cell cultures were positive for this epitope, and that its expression was confined to CD8+ T cells. This epitope was not detected in naive lymphoid cells from the spleen, lymph nodes or thymus or in T cell clones specific for tumors other than FBL-3. The FBL-3-specific CTL clones were next grouped into 127Ep+ and 127Ep- clones. Sequence analyses of the CTL clone used for immunization showed the rearrangements of V alpha 1J alpha 112-2 and V beta 10D beta 2.1J beta 2.7. Southern blot analysis of all the 127Ep+ CTL clones examined showed the same DNA rearrangement bands of both the TcR alpha and beta genes.

In the prevalence analysis, close kinship (sibling OR = 2.75, offspring OR = 2.00, and other relatives OR = 1.70), socioeconomic factors, and the duration of exposure to the bacillus were associated to leprosy.

Indeed, the dispositional (structural) and functional (state-dependent) aspects of cognitions may be seen as reflecting an underlying theme that could be labeled ""the mind as a parliament"".

At the protein level, empirical substitution models have traditionally been based on a large number of different proteins from particular taxonomic levels. However, these models assume that all of the proteins of a taxonomic level evolve under the same substitution patterns. We believe that this assumption is highly unrealistic and should be relaxed by considering protein-specific substitution models that account for protein-specific selection processes. In order to test this hypothesis, we inferred and evaluated four new empirical substitution models for the protease and integrase of HIV and other viruses. We found that these models more accurately fit, compared with any of the currently available empirical substitution models, the evolutionary process of these proteins. We conclude that evolutionary inferences from protein sequences are more accurate if they are based on protein-specific substitution models rather than taxonomic-specific (generalist) substitution models. We also present four new empirical substitution models of protein evolution that could be useful for phylogenetic inferences of viral protease and integrase.",Genes (Basel),Genes,13,1,N/A,2025-11-04 11:00:35,2025-11-04 11:00:35

The resulting bond orientations are in agreement with RDC-refined orientations of either solid or solution state coordinates to within approximately 2 degrees , which is also the estimated precision of the resulting orientations. The squared generalized order parameters, which reflect amplitudes of motion spanning the picosecond to millisecond time scales, exhibit a correlation with picosecond time scale order parameters derived from conventional NMR 15N spin relaxation methods. Provided that RDC measurements can be obtained using many different alignment media, this approach (called direct interpretation of dipolar couplings) may significantly impact the attainable accuracy and the molecular weight range accessible to NMR structure determination in the solution state, as well as provide a route for the study of motions occurring on the nanosecond to microsecond time scales, which have been traditionally difficult to study at atomic resolution.",J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,125,34,10164-5,2025-11-04 11:00:45,2025-11-04 11:00:45

Whereas angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) activates these receptors and promotes cell survival, migration, and sprouting, little information is available regarding how Ang-2 influences these cells. In this study, we evaluated signaling pathways and biological effects of physiological concentrations of Ang-2 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Ang-2 at 150 and 300 ng/ml elicited a transient (reaching peak values within 15 min of exposure) increase in the phosphorylation of Tie-2 receptors, protein kinase B (Akt), ERK1/2, and p38 members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases. However, unlike Ang-1, Ang-2 significantly inhibited JNK/SAPK phosphorylation. When vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was present along with Ang-2, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited, whereas augmentation of Ang-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was triggered by VEGF. Ang-2 treatment had no effect on cell migration and in vitro wound healing but significantly attenuated serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and promoted survival. These effects were completely reversed by phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase and ERK1/2 inhibitors but were augmented by an inhibitor of the p38 pathway. These results suggest that Ang-2 promotes endothelial cell survival through the ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase pathways and that this angiopoietin is not a strong promoter of endothelial cell migration. We also conclude that the nature of interactions in terms of ERK1/2 activation between Ang-2 and VEGF is different from that of Ang-1 and VEGF.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

A review of the published literature was performed to compare and evaluate the development and consequences of antibodies against therapeutic protein agents for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Interferon beta (IFNbeta), glatiramer acetate (GA), and natalizumab are all protein-based therapeutic agents approved to treat MS and are associated with the development of antibodies. Both binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) develop to varying degrees in patients treated with any of the formulations of IFNbeta. Comparison between studies is complicated by differences in methods, assays, criteria for determining NAb positivity, treatment duration, and fluctuation of NAb status. Despite these confounding factors, current data indicate that high-titer persistent NAbs may be relevant in terms of their effect on IFNbeta bioavailability and bioefficacy. GA-reactive antibodies developed in a high proportion of GA-treated patients, but the clinical relevance of these antibodies remains to be established. Immunogenicity against natalizumab was associated with reduced efficacy and increased incidence of infusion reactions. Other emerging monoclonal antibody therapeutics have also been associated with the development of antibodies.

Studies show that, although oral administration of glucose does not significantly decrease total hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 content, it causes an increase in cytosolic protein and in microsomal phospholipid and fatty acid content. In this study we examined the effects of a chronic high sucrose diet (HSD) on liver enzyme activity. Male Fisher 344 weanling rats were randomly assigned to a control diet (0% sucrose by calories, n = 10) or a diet in which starch was replaced by sucrose (65% sucrose, by calories, n = 10) for 90 days. The effects of HSD on weight gain, liver weight, hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP450) content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity were measured and compared with those fed standard lab chow. A small but statistically significant decrease in body weight (g) was seen in the sucrose-fed rats after day 50. Liver GST activity (nmol/mg protein/min) at the end of 90 days was decreased in animals maintained on HSD compared to those on the control diet, (181.7 +/- 8.0, 234.7 +/- 5.5), respectively. The liver weight and total CYP450 content in the two diet groups were not significantly different. The ratios of liver weight to body weight at the end of 90 days suggested that the livers of the HSD-fed animals were larger per gram of body weight. In addition, rats on the HSD had significantly smaller amounts of liver CYP450 1A1 and 3A2 than the rats on the control diet. These results suggest that a HSD may alter the hepatic enzyme activity which may affect the metabolism of substrates for these enzyme systems.",In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",17,1,61-5,2025-11-04 11:00:55,2025-11-04 11:00:55

To demonstrate the functionality of the identified clones, five of 131 clones containing LexA binding sequence have been demonstrated to be induced in response to mitomycin C treatment. To evaluate our libraries as a functional screening library, 80 randomly picked up clones were cultured and treated with and without MMC, where two clones were shown to have greater than twofold induction.

When submerged in oxygenated solution across which an electric field was applied, the roots curved rapidly and strongly toward the positive electrode (anode). The strength of the electrotropic response increased and the latent period decreased with increasing field strength. At a field strength of 7.5 volts per centimeter the latent period was 6.6 minutes and curvature reached 60 degrees in about 1 hour. For electric fields greater than 10 volts per centimeter the latent period was less than 1 minute. There was no response to electric fields less than 2.8 volts per centimeter. Both electrotropism and growth were inhibited when indoleacetic acid (10 micromolar) was included in the medium. The auxin transport inhibitor pyrenoylbenzoic acid strongly inhibited electrotropism without inhibiting growth. Electrotropism was enhanced by treatments that interfere with gravitropism, e.g. decapping the roots or pretreating them with ethyleneglycol-bis-[beta-ethylether]-N,N,N',N' -tetraacetic acid. Similarly, roots of agravitropic pea (Pisum sativum, variety Ageotropum) seedlings were more responsive to electrotropic stimulation than roots of normal (variety Alaska) seedlings. The data indicate that the early steps of gravitropism and electrotropism occur by independent mechanisms.

It was recently shown that some indoles, when reacted with molybdenum hexacarbonyl and cumyl peroxide, proceed through an indoxyl intermediate to produce significant amounts of indirubin through a competing mechanism. Modulation of this system to lower temperatures allows for careful tuning, leading to selective production of indirubins in a general process. A systematic assay of indoles show that electron deficient indoles work well when substituted at the 5 and 7 positions. In contrast, 6-substituted electron rich indoles give the best results whereas halogeno indoles work well in all cases.

Variation in soil C and N availability was achieved by collecting soil from either under tussocks or the bare soil between tussocks, and by amending soil with Themeda litter. We measured N cycling by monitoring: dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-) contents, gross rates of N mineralization and microbial re-mineralization, NH4+ and NO3- immobilization, and autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification. We monitored C availability by measuring cumulative soil respiration and dissolved organic C (DOC). Litter-amended soil had cumulative respiration that was eightfold greater than non-amended soil (2000 compared with 250 microg C/g soil) and almost twice the DOC content (54 compared with 28 microg C/g soil). However, litter-amended soils had only half as much DON accumulation as non-amended soils (9 compared with 17 microg N/g soil) and lower gross N rates (1-4 compared with 13-26 microg N x [g soil](-1) x d(-1)) and NO3- accumulation (0.5 compared with 22 microg N/g soil). Unamended soil from under tussocks had almost twice the soil respiration as soil from between tussocks (300 compared with 175 microg C/g soil), and greater DOC content (33 compared with 24 microg C/g soil). However, unamended soil from under tussocks had lower gross N rates (3-20 compared with 17-31 microg N x [g soil](-1) d(-1)) and NO3- accumulation (18 compared with 25 microg N/g soil) relative to soil from between tussocks. We conclude that N cycling in this grassland is mediated by both C and N limitations that arise from the patchiness of tussocks and seasonal variability in Themeda litterfall. Heterotrophic nitrification rate explained >50% of total nitrification, but this percentage was not affected by proximity to tussocks or litter amendment. A conceptual model that considers DON as central to N cycling processes provided a useful initial framework to explain results of our study. However, to fully explain N cycling in this semiarid grassland soil, the production of NO3- from organic N sources must be included in this model.",Ecology,Ecology,87,8,2047-57,2025-11-04 11:01:14,2025-11-04 11:01:14

The array was fabricated using a high-frequency 1-3 PZT-polymer composite material developed in our laboratory. The spacing of the pillars in the composite was chosen to match the 40-microm center-to-center element spacing of the array electrodes. The element electrodes were created using photolithography, and connections to the electrodes were made using ultrasonic wire bonding. The array was focused in the elevation direction by geometrically shaping the composite material using a cylindrical die with a 6-mm radius of curvature. The resulting transducer produced pulses with a -6 dB two-way bandwidth of 50% and a peak-to-peak pressure of 503 kPa when excited with a +/-30 V monocycle pulse. The measured one-way (-6 dB) directivity for a single array element was 24 degrees and the -3 dB one-way elevation beamwidth was measured to be 130 microm. The radiation pattern for a focused 64-element subaperture was measured by mechanically translating the aperture above a needle hydrophone.

Until recently, the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale.

Swine auricular chondrocytes were encapsulated either directly after isolation (p = 0), or after further in vitro expansion ( p = 1 and p = 2) in a 2 wt%, 50-kDa HA hydrogel and implanted subcutaneously in the dorsum of nude mice. After 12 weeks, constructs were explanted for mechanical testing and biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis and compared to controls of HA gels alone and native cartilage. The compressive equilibrium moduli of the p = 0 and p = 1 constructs (51.2 +/- 8.0 and 72.5 +/- 35.2 kPa, respectively) were greater than the p = 2 constructs (26.8 +/- 14.9 kPa) and the control HA gel alone (12.3 +/- 1.3 kPa) and comparable to auricular cartilage (35.1 +/- 12.2 kPa). Biochemical analysis showed a general decrease in glycosaminoglycan (GAG), collagen, and elastin content with chondrocyte passage, though no significant differences were found between the p = 0 and p = 1 constructs for any of the analyses. Histological staining showed intense and uniform staining for aggrecan, as well as greater type II collagen versus type I collagen staining in all constructs. Overall, this study illustrates that constructs with the p = 0 and p = 1 auricular chondrocytes produced neocartilage tissue that resembled native auricular cartilage after 12 weeks in vivo.

Here we describe a mechanistic basis for designing Met antagonists based on NK1, a natural variant of HGF containing the N-terminal and the first kringle domain. Through detailed biochemical and structural analyses, we demonstrate that both mouse and human NK1 induce Met dimerization via a conserved NK1 dimer interface. Mutations designed to alter the NK1 dimer interface abolish its ability to promote Met dimerization but retain full Met-binding activity. Importantly, these NK1 mutants act as Met antagonists by inhibiting HGF-mediated cell scattering, proliferation, branching, and invasion. The ability to separate the Met-binding activity of NK1 from its Met dimerization activity thus provides a rational basis for designing Met antagonists. This strategy of antagonist design may be applicable for other growth factor receptors by selectively abolishing the receptor activation ability but not the receptor binding of the growth factors.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,104,37,14592-7,2025-11-04 11:01:20,2025-11-04 11:01:20

This study evaluated efficacy and safety of rFVIIa and an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC; Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity [FEIBA], Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) for controlling joint bleeds in a home-treatment setting.

Efficacy was assessed by the requirement for additional haemostatics within 9 h and by a novel global response algorithm. The percentage of rFVIIa 270 microg kg(-1) group patients requiring additional haemostatics within 9 h (8.3%) was significantly lower than that for the APCC group (36.4%, P = 0.032).

A reaction mixture for cell-free protein synthesis was designed to synthesize a bacterial invertase in response to exogenous addition of a specific amino acid. The invertase synthesized upon addition of an assay sample containing the amino acid of interest was used to convert sucrose into glucose, which was detected using a PGM. The titers of the amino acid in assay samples were precisely represented by the readouts of a PGM.

After a median observation time of 24 months (range 12-48 months) body weight fell significantly from a median of 124.0 kg to 81.2 kg in the jejunoileal bypass patients whilst median BP decreased significantly from 140/85 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg. In the patients treated with diet, body weight decreased significantly from a median of 129.0 kg to 119.0 kg after a median observation time of 18 months (range 9-36 months) whereas the median BP of 140/90 mmHg was unaffected. The fall in BP after weight loss was significantly positively correlated with the height of BP before the weight loss. The correlation could not be explained by a greater weight loss in the patients with initially high BP. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation between BP changes and body weight changes was demonstrated, but this correlation was lesser than the above-mentioned. The study shows that the beneficial effect of a weight loss upon BP in obese patients is greater the higher the initial BP is, but also that a normal BP is only little affected and explained mainly by cuff artifact.",Int J Obes,International journal of obesity,6,3,307-12,2025-11-04 11:01:35,2025-11-04 11:01:35

In the present study we have investigated the interaction of these abnormal LDL with LDL receptors of normal human fibroblasts. Since the ultracentrifugally separated LDL fraction (1.019 < d < 1.063 g mL-1) from the CETP-deficient patients contained HDLc-like particles, these particles were removed by anti-apolipoprotein (apo) A-I immunoaffinity column chromatography. The lipoproteins eluted in the unbound fraction of this column did not contain apo A-I, so this fraction was considered to be authentic LDL. The authentic LDL of the patients were deficient in CE and rich in triglycerides and apo B. The authentic LDL itself showed polydispersity, ranging in size from 23 nm to 30 nm. The affinity of these abnormal LDL particles for LDL receptors was analysed by a competitive assay in which cold LDL from the patients or control compete with 125I-labelled LDL for fibroblast LDL receptors. The concentration of LDL particles at which 50% of 125I-labelled normal LDL was replaced was two to three times higher for the patients than for the normal control. Therefore, the affinity of patient LDL was thought to be reduced compared to that of control LDL. These results demonstrate that CETP may play an important role in making LDL particles homogeneous and rich in CE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,25,5,332-9,2025-11-04 11:01:37,2025-11-04 11:01:37

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of coagulation Factor II (FII), Factor VIII (FVIII), fibrinogen and bacterial growth in thawed refrozen FFP. Thirty FFP samples were collected from healthy donors. FFP were thawed in water bath at 37 °C for 20-25 min. Approximately 10 mL of plasma from each FFP unit was tested for FII, FVIII, fibrinogen and sterility. The thawed FFP units were then kept at 4 °C for 6 h before being refrozen and stored at - 20 °C. Two weeks later, the refrozen FFP were thawed again and representative samples were analysed as before. There was a significant decline in the mean FVIII level, from 155.77% to 85.6% at second thaw. The mean FII level increased significantly from 74.9% to 82%, whereas the mean fibrinogen level fell from 3.34g/L to 3.28 g/L, but the decline was not statistically significant. There was no bacterial contamination in all samples at both time points. Refrozen plasma may be considered as an alternative to the storage of thawed unused FFP provided they are kept in a controlled environment to reduce wastage.

Co-infection with HIV increases HCV virus load, liver-related mortality, and the risk of sexual and perinatal transmission of HCV, and it may accelerate HCV disease progression. With combination interferon (IFN)-alpha 2b/ribavirin or pegylated IFN-alpha 2b/ribavirin therapy, long-term remission is possible for HCV-infected patients. Preliminary evidence suggests that the combination of IFN-alpha 2b/ribavirin can achieve similar response rates in HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals with no adverse effect on HIV RNA concentrations. Although adverse effects are more frequent with combination therapy than with IFN-alpha monotherapy, most are manageable. In addition, few instances of drug-drug antagonism have been reported among drugs used to treat each disease, although further study is necessary.

Previous studies have shown that monomers lacking or possessing mutant oligomerization domains bind RNA with low affinity, strongly suggesting a cooperative protomer-RNA binding mode. In order to understand the role of the oligomerization domain in defining the biological functions and structure of hnRNP C tetramers, we have determined the high-resolution NMR structure of the oligomerization interface that is formed at the core of the complex, examining specific molecular interactions that drive assembly and contribute to the structural integrity of the tetramer. The determined structure reveals an antiparallel four-helix coiled coil, where classically described knobs-into-holes packing interactions at interhelical contact surfaces are optimized so that side-chains interdigitate to create an even distribution of hydrophobic surfaces along the core. While the stoichiometry of the complex appears to be primarily specified by occlusion of hydrophobic surfaces, particularly the interfacial residue L198, from solvent, helix orientation is primarily determined by electrostatic attractions across helix interfaces. The creation of potential interaction surfaces for other hnRNP C domains along the coiled coil exterior and the assembly of oligomerization interfaces in an antiparallel orientation shape the tertiary fold of full-length monomers and juxtapose RNA-binding elements at distal surfaces of the tetrameric complex in the quaternary assembly. In addition, we discuss the specific challenges encountered in structure determination of this symmetric oligomer by NMR methods, specifically in sorting ambiguous interatomic distance constraints into classes that define different elements of the coiled coil structure.",J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,350,2,319-37,2025-11-04 11:01:40,2025-11-04 11:01:40

The single terminal aldehydes of oligomannosyl residues released by hydrolysis were tagged with the charged fluorophore 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) and separated with high resolution on the basis of size by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ANTS fluorescence labeling was not biased by oligomannoside length; therefore, band fluorescence intensity was directly related to the relative abundance of individual oligomannoside moieties in heterogeneous samples. FACE analysis revealed the major oligomannosides released by acid hydrolysis and beta-elimination of Fehling-precipitated mannan from Candida albicans, which were the same as those previously reported in studies based on mass and nuclear magnetic spectroscopic analysis. FACE was also amenable to the analysis of samples obtained by direct hydrolysis of whole yeast cells. Whole-cell acid hydrolysis and whole-cell beta-elimination of two isolates each of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, C. rugosa, C. stellatoidea, and C. tropicalis resulted in oligomannoside gel banding patterns that were species and strain specific for the 16 isolates surveyed.

The 6-OHDA lesion caused a 60% reduction of striatal dopamine (DA) concentration when analyzed in the adult stage, while 5-HT levels were increased by about 40% and 3H-5-HT uptake in vitro was increased by about 60%. Using computerized image analysis, a marked increase in 5-HT-like immunoreactive terminal density was found in both rostral (+200%) and caudal (+50%) striatum. Pretreatment with the DA uptake blocker amfolenic acid completely counteracted the 6-OHDA-induced alterations in both DA and 5-HT neurons in the striatum, while pretreatment with the noradrenaline uptake blocker desipramine had no significant effects. Regional analysis of 5-HT levels in the CNS after neonatal 6-OHDA treatment or the combined desipramine + 6-OHDA treatment showed no significant effect in any of the brain areas analyzed, apart from the observed 5-HT increase in striatum.

Therefore, as part of a broader project to identify the key principles and clinical practice and training standards for mental health professionals and dietitians providing eating disorder treatment, the Australia & New Zealand Academy for Eating Disorders (ANZAED) sought to identify the key practice and training standards specific to dietitians. An expert working group of dietitians was convened to draft the initial dietetic standards. After expert review, feedback on the revised standards was then provided by 100 health professionals working within the eating disorder sector.

The genotypes of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in drug metabolizing enzymes were detected by the SNPstream(®) Genotyping System. The correlation between the distribution of genotypes and the complete remission rate of first induction chemotherapy was analyzed by logical regression. The results showed that patients with variant genotype of CYP2D6 (rs16947) had a lower complete remission (CR) rate, as compared to those with wild type (p = 0.033, OR = 0.32, 95%CI 0.112 - 0.915); meanwhile the patients with variant genotype of GSTO2 (rs156697) had a higher CR rate as compared to those with wild type (p = 0.011, OR = 3.023, 95%CI 1.289 - 7.089). Combined analysis of the above polymorphisms, showed that patients with variant genotype of CYP2D6 and wild genotype of GSTO2 (V + W) had lower CR rates in comparison to patients with wild genotypes of both polymorphisms (p = 0.017, OR = 0.183, 95%CI 0.045 - 0.735).

This pigment contains 11-cis-retinal as the chromophore. Raman data have been obtained for the acid metarhodopsin at 10 degrees C in both H2O and D2O. The C = N stretching mode at 1660 cm-1 in H2O shifts to 1631 cm-1 upon deuteriation of the sample, clearly showing a protonated Schiff base linkage between the chromophore and the protein. The structure-sensitive fingerprint region shows similarities to the all-trans-protonated Schiff base of model retinal chromophores, as well as to the octopus acid metarhodopsin and bovine metarhodopsin I. Although spectra measured at -100 degrees C with 406.7-nm excitation, to enhance scattering from rhodopsin (lambda max 345 nm), contain a significant contribution from a small amount of contaminants [cytochrome(s) and/or accessory pigment] in the sample, the C = N stretch at 1664 cm-1 suggests a protonated Schiff base linkage between the chromophore and the protein in rhodopsin as well. For comparison, this mode also appears at approximately 1660 cm-1 in both the vertebrate (bovine) and the invertebrate (octopus) rhodopsins. These data are particularly interesting since the absorption maximum of 345 nm for rhodopsin might be expected to originate from an unprotonated Schiff base linkage. That the Schiff base linkage in the owlfly rhodopsin, like in bovine and in octopus, is protonated suggests that a charged chromophore is essential to visual transduction.",Biochemistry,Biochemistry,26,23,7426-30,2025-11-04 11:01:56,2025-11-04 11:01:56

In three groups of dogs, kidneys received continuous infusions of either superoxide dismutase (SOD) and normal saline (six dogs), heat-inactivated SOD and normal saline (six dogs), or normal saline alone (four dogs). Urinary THP excretion, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, mean arterial pressure, and renal venous malondialdehyde concentrations were measured before and after administration of contrast medium to each kidney. During the postcontrast period, SOD significantly attenuated the increase in urinary THP excretion, accompanied by an attenuated increase in renal venous malondialdehyde concentration. Heat-inactivated SOD did not attenuate renal hemodynamics or urinary THP excretion. The use of another contrast medium, iothalamate sodium, similarly increased urinary THP excretion. These results show that intrarenal administration of contrast medium induces a transient increase in urinary THP mediated in part by oxygen free radical damage to the kidney. Thus, THP may be a marker of renal tubular injury after injection of contrast medium.",Radiology,Radiology,175,1,57-60,2025-11-04 11:01:57,2025-11-04 11:01:57

Repeated overexposure to noise at or above 85 dBA can cause permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, and difficulty understanding speech in noise. It is also associated with cardiovascular disease, depression, balance problems, and lower income. About 22 million U.S. workers are currently exposed to hazardous occupational noise. Approximately 33% of working-age adults with a history of occupational noise exposure have audiometric evidence of noise-induced hearing damage, and 16% of noise-exposed workers have material hearing impairment. While the Mining, Construction, and Manufacturing sectors typically have the highest prevalence of noise exposure and hearing loss, there are noise-exposed workers in every sector and every sector has workers with hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss is preventable. Increased understanding of the biological processes underlying noise damage may lead to protective pharmacologic or genetic therapies. For now, an integrated public health approach that (1) emphasizes noise control over reliance on hearing protection, (2) illustrates the full impact of hearing loss on quality of life, and (3) challenges the cultural acceptance of loud noise can substantially reduce the impact of noise on worker health.",J Acoust Soc Am,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,146,5,3879,2025-11-04 11:01:58,2025-11-04 11:01:58

The response magnitude of neurons to a given image often depends on the size at which the image is presented, usually on a flat display at a fixed distance. While such size sensitivity might simply reflect the angular subtense of retinal image stimulation in degrees, one unexplored possibility is that it tracks the real-world geometry of physical objects, such as their size and distance to the observer in centimeters. This distinction bears fundamentally on the nature of object representation in IT and on the scope of visual operations supported by the ventral visual pathway. To address this question, we assessed the response dependency of neurons in the macaque anterior fundus (AF) face patch to the angular versus physical size of faces. We employed a macaque avatar to stereoscopically render three-dimensional (3D) photorealistic faces at multiple sizes and distances, including a subset of size/distance combinations designed to cast the same size retinal image projection. We found that most AF neurons were modulated principally by the 3D physical size of the face rather than its two-dimensional (2D) angular size on the retina. Further, most neurons responded strongest to extremely large and small faces, rather than to those of normal size. Together, these findings reveal a graded encoding of physical size among face patch neurons, providing evidence that category-selective regions of the primate ventral visual pathway participate in a geometric analysis of real-world objects.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,120,9,e2214996120,2025-11-04 11:02:00,2025-11-04 11:02:00

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) accelerate ageing, while there is a concomitant rise in oxidative stress known to promote stress-induced senescence (SIS) in vitro. Of all risk factors for CVD, smoking is most associated with the development of inflammation and accelerated atherosclerosis due to a prooxidant-antioxidant imbalance. We tested the hypothesis that SIS predominates in EC isolated from chronic smokers with premature atherosclerosis undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). We isolated and cultured EC from segments of internal mammary arteries from smoker, former smoker, and nonsmoker coronary patients. Senescence of EC was induced by serial passage and quantified by the measurement of telomere length and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Compared with nonsmokers, smoker patients were 10 years younger at the time of CABG, evidence of premature atherosclerosis. Cellular senescence was independent of telomere length and directly related to oxidative damage. EC exhibited higher expression levels of markers of oxidative stress (lipid peroxydation level and caveolin-1 mRNA), inflammation (angiopoietin-like 2 mRNA), hypoxia (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A mRNA), and cell damage (p53 mRNA).

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relative contribution of cutaneous afferent pathways as a substrate for cross-education by directly assessing how ""enhanced"" cutaneous stimulation alters ipsilateral and contralateral strength gains in the forearm. Twenty-seven right-handed participants were randomly assigned to 1-of-3 training groups and completed 6 sets of 8 repetitions 3x/week for 5 weeks. Voluntary training (TRAIN) included unilateral maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the wrist extensors. Cutaneous stimulation (STIM), a sham training condition, included cutaneous stimulation (2x radiating threshold; 3sec; 50Hz) of the superficial radial (SR) nerve at the wrist. TRAIN + STIM training included MVCs of the wrist extensors with simultaneous SR stimulation. Two pre- and one posttraining session assessed the relative increase in force output during MVCs of isometric wrist extension, wrist flexion, and handgrip. Maximal voluntary muscle activation was simultaneously recorded from the flexor and extensor carpi radialis. Cutaneous reflex pathways were evaluated through stimulation of the SR nerve during graded ipsilateral contractions. Results indicate TRAIN increased force output compared with STIM in both trained (85.0 ± 6.2 Nm vs. 59.8 ± 6.1 Nm) and untrained wrist extensors (73.9 ± 3.5 Nm vs. 58.8 Nm). Providing 'enhanced' sensory input during training (TRAIN + STIM) also led to increases in strength in the trained limb compared with STIM (79.3 ± 6.3 Nm vs. 59.8 ± 6.1 Nm). However, in the untrained limb no difference occurred between TRAIN + STIM and STIM (63.0 ± 3.7 Nm vs. 58.8 Nm). This suggests when 'enhanced' input was provided independent of timing with active muscle contraction, interlimb strength transfer to the untrained wrist extensors was blocked. This indicates that the sensory volley may have interfered with the integration of appropriate sensorimotor cues required to facilitate an interlimb transfer, highlighting the importance of appropriately timed cutaneous feedback.",Physiol Rep,Physiological reports,8,6,e14406,2025-11-04 11:02:11,2025-11-04 11:02:11

The effect of time, solution and material on primary and secondary color coordinates was estimated using two-way repeated ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons, at a = 0.05. The results showed that coffee strongly affected all the materials (p < 0.05), followed by tea and chocolate. Sinfony presented the highest color change (p < 0.05), due to changes in b* and L* coordinates. Color coordinates were affected differently by material type and solution. In conclusion, this study showed that the color of indirect resin composites was affected by all three examined factors (immersion time, staining solution and material type), in a clinically appreciable level (ΔΕ* > 2.7 U) even from the first week, and in an unacceptable level (ΔΕ* > 5.5 U) in the second, third and fourth week, depending on the staining solution and the material.",Odontology,Odontology,102,2,189-96,2025-11-04 11:02:12,2025-11-04 11:02:12

This technique has been extensively used to study translation, with the unique ability to provide information about ribosomes positioning along transcripts at single-nucleotide resolution. Classical ribosome profiling approaches do not distinguish between fragments protected by either actively translating or inactive ribosomes. Here we describe an original method, called active ribosome profiling or RiboLace, which is based on a unique puromycin-containing molecule capable of isolating active ribosomes by means of an antibody-free and tag-free pull-down approach. This method allows reliable estimates of the translational state of any biological system, in high concordance with protein levels. RiboLace can be applied both in vitro and in vivo and generates snapshots of active ribosome footprints at single-nucleotide resolution and genome-wide level.

30333583,N/A,2018,Improved limit on the electric dipole moment of the electron.,"The standard model of particle physics accurately describes all particle physics measurements made so far in the laboratory. However, it is unable to answer many questions that arise from cosmological observations, such as the nature of dark matter and why matter dominates over antimatter throughout the Universe. Theories that contain particles and interactions beyond the standard model, such as models that incorporate supersymmetry, may explain these phenomena. Such particles appear in the vacuum and interact with common particles to modify their properties. For example, the existence of very massive particles whose interactions violate time-reversal symmetry, which could explain the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry, can give rise to an electric dipole moment along the spin axis of the electron. No electric dipole moments of fundamental particles have been observed. However, dipole moments only slightly smaller than the current experimental bounds have been predicted to arise from particles more massive than any known to exist. Here we present an improved experimental limit on the electric dipole moment of the electron, obtained by measuring the electron spin precession in a superposition of quantum states of electrons subjected to a huge intramolecular electric field. The sensitivity of our measurement is more than one order of magnitude better than any previous measurement. This result implies that a broad class of conjectured particles, if they exist and time-reversal symmetry is maximally violated, have masses that greatly exceed what can be measured directly at the Large Hadron Collider.",Nature,Nature,562,7727,355-360,2025-11-04 11:02:14,2025-11-04 11:02:14

The monolayer adsorption capacity of RSD was found to be 62.71 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics can be predicted by the pseudo-first-order model. The mechanism of adsorption was also studied. It was found that for a short time period the rate of adsorption is controlled by film diffusion. However, at longer adsorption times, pore-diffusion controls the rate of adsorption.

ODQ (1 nM-30 microM) inhibited cyclic GMP accumulation in endothelial cells stimulated with S-nitrosoglutathione, nitroprusside and 3-morpholine-sydnonimine at IC50 values of 40 to 100 nM. Complete suppression of cyclic GMP generation was observed at approximately 10 microM. Relaxation of pulmonary artery strips induced by S-nitrosoglutathione, nitroprusside, glycerol trinitrate, nitrite (all endothelium-independent), bradykinin and the Ca++ ionophore A23187 (endothelium-dependent) were antagonized by ODQ (1-10 microM) in a concentration-dependent way. A consistent feature of the inhibitor was that maximal relaxant effects also were reduced. Basal levels and agonist-induced increases in arterial tissue cyclic GMP were inhibited in the same concentration range. However, tissue cyclic GMP production correlated poorly with pulmonary artery relaxation in that relaxations induced by S-nitrosoglutathione were only inhibited in part (50%), whereas rises in cyclic GMP were abolished completely by ODQ (10 microM). Furthermore, at 1 microM, ODQ had no effect on relaxation induced by endothelium-dependent agonists, but prevented entirely stimulation of cyclic GMP accumulation in arterial tissue. These results suggest that ODQ inhibits nitrovasodilator-induced and endothelium-dependent relaxation through inhibition of guanylyl cyclase activation, but also point to the presence of a cyclic GMP-independent component of relaxation in bovine pulmonary artery.",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,277,1,48-53,2025-11-04 11:02:23,2025-11-04 11:02:23

Reports of the effectiveness of natural and synthetic isoflavones in preventing or treating osteoporosis led us to examine the effect of soy protein in reversing established bone loss. Seventy-two 95-d-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 6 groups. The rats were either sham operated (SHAM; 2 groups) or ovariectomized (OVX; 4 groups) and then fed a casein-based, semipurified diet. Thirty-five days after surgery, 1 SHAM and 1 OVX group were killed to examine the occurrence of bone loss. Thereafter, the other SHAM and 1 OVX groups continued to receive the casein-based diet. Whereas the remaining 2 OVX groups received diets in which casein was replaced by soy protein with normal (OVX+SOY) or reduced (OVX+SOY-) isoflavone content for 65 days. The OVX control group had significantly lower femoral and fourth lumbar vertebral bone densities than the SHAM group. Femoral density of rats fed SOY or SOY- diets were not significantly different from SHAM or OVX controls. This suggests a slight reversal of cortical bone loss that may be partially due to higher femoral insulin-like growth factor I mRNA transcripts resulting from both the SOY and SOY- diets. The ovariectomy-induced increases in indexes of bone turnover were not ameliorated by either of the soy diets, suggesting that any positive effect of soy was achieved through enhanced bone formation rather than slowed bone resorption.

Compared with the adult, prepubertal vitrified/warmed blastocysts showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower in vitro viability, as determined by the re-expansion rate (62.5% and 40.3%). No differences were observed in the time required for blastocoel re-expansion or in cyclin B1, E-cadherin, Na/K ATPase, HSP90beta and aquaporin 3 messenger RNA quantity. These results show that in vitro-produced embryos produced from prepubertal goat oocytes have a lower developmental rate and cryotolerance compared with their adult counterparts. However, we can assume that the quality of re-expanded embryos does not differ between the two groups.",Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",21,7,901-8,2025-11-04 11:02:28,2025-11-04 11:02:28

The enhancement of photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the synergistic effect among CeO2, g-C3N4 and N-rGO (serves as a conductive network), which was found to lead to more efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, resulting in the effective photodegradation of organic pollutants. In addition, superoxide radical anions (˙O2(-)) and holes (h(+)) were considered as the main reactive species during the photodegradation process, and the ternary composite also exhibited preferable stability for the decomposition of RhB.

The cellular phenomena associated with laminopathy invariably show disruption of nucleoskeleton of lamina due to deregulated expression, localization, function, and interaction of mutant lamin proteins. Impaired spatial and temporal tethering of lamin proteins to the lamina or nucleoplasmic aggregation of lamins are the primary molecular events that can trigger nuclear proteotoxicity by modulating differential protein-protein interactions, sequestering quality control proteins, and initiating a cascade of abnormal post-translational modifications. Clearly, laminopathic cells exhibit moderate to high nuclear proteotoxicity, raising the question of whether an imbalance in nuclear proteostasis is involved in laminopathic diseases, particularly in diseases of early aging such as HGPS and laminopathy-associated premature aging.

The blood content (BC) of human skin and the velocity of red blood cells (RBV) has been comprehensively mapped over 30 anatomical sites in 28 volunteers between the age of 7 and 77 years using reflectance spectrophotometry (RFS) and laser Doppler (LD) techniques respectively. Total skin thickness, which may have a relationship with blood content, has been mapped at the same anatomical sites in six of the volunteers using two-dimensional array, 12 MHz ultrasound equipment. The major determinant of BC and RBV was found to be anatomical site. Regardless of age, gender or prior sun exposure, anatomical sites above the waist produced higher readings than below. BC and RBV were found to be dependent on age and gender at most sites with higher readings being observed in males and younger volunteers. The largest difference was seen in males under 55 years whose RFS readings above the waist were significantly higher than in older males or females of any age. Heavy prior sun exposure and skin thickness could not be demonstrated to impact on either RFS or LD readings independently of the effects of anatomical site, gender or age. In general, RFS and LD readings paralleled one another and correlated linearly at most anatomical sites. While RFS readings tended to decrease in the cranio-caudal direction, LD readings were relatively uniform across the body except for the head and groin where they were higher, and the abdomen where they were lower. The site-to-site variations in RFS readings observed in this study correspond well to capillary density variations noted in previous studies.",Physiol Meas,Physiological measurement,18,3,155-70,2025-11-04 11:02:47,2025-11-04 11:02:47

Those with primary roles include Dicer-like (DCL), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Protein families such as double-stranded RNA-binding (DRB), SERRATE (SE), and SUPPRESSION OF SILENCING 3 (SGS3) act as partners of DCL or RDR proteins. Here, we present curated annotations and phylogenetic analyses of seven sRNA pathway protein families performed on 196 species in the Viridiplantae (aka green plants) lineage. Our results suggest that the RDR3 proteins emerged earlier than RDR1/2/6. RDR6 is found in filamentous green algae and all land plants, suggesting that the evolution of RDR6 proteins coincides with the evolution of phased small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). We traced the origin of the 24-nt reproductive phased siRNA-associated DCL5 protein back to the American sweet flag (Acorus americanus), the earliest diverged, extant monocot species. Our analyses of AGOs identified multiple duplication events of AGO genes that were lost, retained, or further duplicated in subgroups, indicating that the evolution of AGOs is complex in monocots. The results also refine the evolution of several clades of AGO proteins, such as AGO4, AGO6, AGO17, and AGO18. Analyses of nuclear localization signal sequences and catalytic triads of AGO proteins shed light on the regulatory roles of diverse AGOs. Collectively, this work generates a curated and evolutionarily coherent annotation for gene families involved in plant sRNA biogenesis/function and provides insights into the evolution of major sRNA pathways.",Plant Physiol,Plant physiology,192,2,1183-1203,2025-11-04 11:02:49,2025-11-04 11:02:49
22475295,"Loes Koring, Pim Mak, Eric Reuland",2012,The time course of argument reactivation revealed: using the visual world paradigm.,"Previous research has found that the single argument of unaccusative verbs (such as fall) is reactivated during sentence processing, but the argument of agentive verbs (such as jump) is not (Bever & Sanz, 1997; Friedmann, Taranto, Shapiro, & Swinney, 2008). An open question so far was whether this difference in processing is caused by a difference in thematic roles the verbs assign, or a difference in the underlying syntactic structure. In the present study we tease apart these two potential sources. In order to achieve this, we included a set of verbs (like sparkle) which are equal to unaccusative verbs in the thematic role they assign to their argument, but equal to agentive verbs in the syntactic status of their argument (henceforth mixed verbs). As a method we used the visual world paradigm as this enables us to measure processing of the sentences continuously. This method also allowed us to test another hypothesis, namely the hypothesis that not only the argument of unaccusative verbs is reactivated during processing, but also the argument of agentive verbs. This reactivation is expected as the result of integrating the verb and its argument into one representation. In our experiment, participants listened to sentences including one of the three types of verbs. While listening, they viewed a visual display in which one of four objects was strongly related to the argument of the verb (wood-saw). The gaze record showed that the eyes moved to the related object (saw) upon presentation of the argument (wood). More interestingly, the eyes moved back to the related object upon presentation of the verb (fell). We found that looks to the related object increase only late after verb offset for unaccusative verbs, replicating the findings of previous research. We also found a rise in looks to the related object in agentive verbs, but this rise took place much earlier, starting slightly after verb onset. Finally, we found that mixed verbs pattern in processing with agentive verbs. We conclude that the argument of the verb is always reactivated, independent of verb type. In addition, the timing of integration differs per verb type and depends on the syntactic status of the argument and not on the thematic role that is assigned to the argument.",Cognition,Cognition,123,3,361-79,2025-11-04 11:02:50,2025-11-04 11:02:50

31456203,"Guofen Gao, Jie Li, Yating Zhang, Yan-Zhong Chang",2019,Cellular Iron Metabolism and Regulation.,"Iron is an essential trace element in the human body, but excess iron is toxic as it contributes to oxidative damage. To keep iron concentration within the optimal physiologic range, iron metabolism at the cellular level and the whole systemic level are tightly regulated. Balance of iron homeostasis depends on the expression levels and activities of iron carriers, iron transporters, and iron regulatory and storage proteins. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) at the apical membrane of intestinal enterocyte brings in non-heme iron from the diet, whereas ferroportin 1 (FPN1) at the basal membrane exports iron into the circulation. Plasma transferrin (Tf) then carries iron to various tissues and cells. After binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), the complex is endocytosed into the cell, where iron enters the cytoplasm via DMT1 on the endosomal membrane. Free iron is either utilized in metabolic processes, such as synthesis of hemoglobin and Fe-S cluster, or sequestered in the cytosolic ferritin, serving as a cellular iron store. Excess iron can be exported from the cell via FPN1. The liver-derived peptide hepcidin plays a major regulatory role in controlling FPN1 level in the enterocyte, and thus controls the whole-body iron absorption. Inside the cells, iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) modulate the expressions of DMT1, TfR1, ferritin, and FPN1 via binding to the iron-responsive element (IRE) in their mRNAs. Both the release of hepcidin and the IRP-IRE interaction are coordinated with the fluctuation of the cellular iron level. Therefore, an adequate and steady iron supplement is warranted for the utilization of cells around the body. Investigations on the molecular mechanisms of cellular iron metabolism and regulation could advance the fields of iron physiology and pathophysiology.",Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,1173,N/A,21-32,2025-11-04 11:02:54,2025-11-04 11:02:54

The two types of internalization are introjection, which entails taking in a value or regulatory process but not accepting it as one's own, and integration, through which the regulation is assimilated with one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally controlling regulation, whereas integration results in self-determination.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Adult patients (age 14 to 65 years) with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) diagnosis based on the spirometry with methacholine challenge test were entered into the study. The study was conducted in the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. Patients were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 20 mg/day or placebo for 4 weeks. Spirometric parameters were determined at baseline and at completion of the study. Twenty two patients with the age of 32.95±10.30 years completed the trial. Changes in airway responsiveness categories (moderate to severe, mild, borderline, normal) after the intervention were not significant in atorvastatin group as in placebo group (p-value= 0.131 for atorvastatin group and p-value = 0.305 for placebo group). Also, changes in methacholine solution number (different concentrations of methacholine) which caused at least 20% decrease in FEV1 were not significant between groups (p-value = 0.089). Although we could not find a significant difference, the patients' fall in FEV1 in atorvastatin group was observed in higher concentrations of methacholine. Median before treatment versus after treatment in atorvastatin group was 1 versus 4 mg/mL, while those were 2 versus 1 mg/mL in placebo group.

Therefore, a thorough assessment of GO toxicity, including its potential reliance on key physicochemical factors, which is lacking in the literature, is of high significance and importance. In this study, GO toxicity, and its dependence on oxidation level, elemental composition, and size, were comprehensively assessed. A newly established quantitative toxicogenomic-based toxicity testing approach, combined with conventional phenotypic bioassays, were employed. The toxicogenomic assay utilized a GFP-fused yeast reporter library covering key cellular toxicity pathways. The results reveal that, indeed, the elemental composition and size do exert impacts on GO toxicity, while the oxidation level exhibits no significant effects. The UV-treated GO, with significantly higher carbon-carbon groups and carboxyl groups, showed a higher toxicity level, especially in the protein and chemical stress categories. With the decrease in size, the toxicity level of the sonicated GOs tended to increase.

Experientia 50: 1092-1098). Hsp72 was shown to protect cells from a variety of stresses. The protective function of Hsp72 has been commonly ascribed to its chaperoning ability. However, recently we showed that Hsp72 protects cells from heat shock by suppression of a stress-kinase JNK, an essential component of the heat-induced apoptotic pathway (Gabai VL, Meriin AB, Mosser DD, Caron AW, Rits S, Shifrin VI and Sherman MY (1997) Hsp70 prevents activation of stress kinases. A novel pathway of cellular thermotolerance. J Biol Chem 272: 18033-18037). Here we demonstrate that because of the diminished inducibility of Hsp72 in aged cells, Hsp72-mediated control of JNK signaling pathway is compromised. This results in increased rate of apoptotic cell death following heat shock. We show that forced expression of Hsp72 in aged cells from an adenovirus-based vector completely suppresses activation of JNK by heat shock and consequently protects from heat-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to restore endogenous expression of Hsp72 in aged cells. This can be achieved by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Induction of Hsp72 in aged cells under these conditions leads to suppression of JNK activation by a heat shock and restoration of thermotolerance manifested in a lower rate of apoptosis.",Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,3,4,265-71,2025-11-04 11:03:02,2025-11-04 11:03:02

Here, we investigated whether SP has a role in regulating NK92-MI cell function in vitro, and how it influences NK cell activity. We found that SP dose dependently increased the cytotoxicity of NK92-MI cells and had a maximal effect at a concentration of 10(-12) and 10(-10) m. Furthermore, the expression of cytotoxic-associated molecules (perforin, granzyme) and activating receptor NKp46 [a member of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs)] was observed to be upregulated by SP at optimal concentration, at which SP enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK92-MI cells. Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a functional receptor of SP, was found on NK92-MI cells, and the observed effects of SP on NK92-MI cells could be more partially blocked by an NK-1R antagonist. Our data suggest that SP induces NK92-MI cell cytotoxicity by directly increasing the expression of cytotoxic granules and upregulates NK92-MI cell receptor-mediated functions indirectly.

Antiresorptive therapies have demonstrated efficacy for reducing the risk of skeletal-related events and ameliorating bone pain. Despite the well documented clinical benefits of antiresorptive therapies, patient benefits can be limited or compromised by nonadherence with scheduled therapy. Potential reasons for poor compliance include lack of understanding of how antiresorptive therapies work, neglecting the importance of bone health in maintaining quality of life, and being unaware of the potentially debilitating effects of skeletal-related events caused by bone metastases. Indeed, patients may stop therapy after bone pain subsides or discontinue due to generally mild and usually manageable adverse events, leaving them at an increased risk of developing skeletal-related events. In addition, the cost of antiresorptive therapy can be a concern for many patients with cancer. Medical care for patients with cancer requires a coordinated effort between primary care physicians and oncologists. Patients' medical care teams can be leveraged to help educate them about the importance of adherence to antiresorptive therapy when cancer has metastasized to bone. Because primary care physicians generally have more contact with their patients than oncologists, they are in a unique position to understand patient perceptions and habits that may lead to noncompliance and to help educate patients about the benefits and risks of various antiresorptive therapies in the advanced cancer setting. Therefore, primary care physicians need to be aware of various mechanistic and clinical considerations regarding antiresorptive treatment options.",Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,4,N/A,287-97,2025-11-04 11:03:09,2025-11-04 11:03:09

In the neurohypophysis in which the axons of SON neurons terminate, taurine is also concentrated in and osmo-dependently released by pituicytes, the specialized glial cells ensheathing nerve terminals. We now show that taurine release from isolated neurohypophyses is enhanced by hypo-osmotic and decreased by hyper-osmotic stimulation. The high osmosensitivity is shown by the significant increase on only 3.3% reduction in osmolarity. Inhibition of taurine release by 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, niflumic acid, and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid suggests the involvement of volume-sensitive anion channels. On purified neurohypophysial nerve endings, activation of strychnine-sensitive GlyRs by taurine or glycine primarily inhibits the high K(+)-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and subsequent release of vasopressin. Expression of GlyRs in vasopressin and oxytocin terminals is confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Their implication in the osmoregulation of neurohormone secretion was assessed on isolated whole neurohypophyses. A 6.6% hypo-osmotic stimulus reduces by half the depolarization-evoked vasopressin secretion, an inhibition totally prevented by strychnine. Most importantly, depletion of taurine by a taurine transport inhibitor also abolishes the osmo-dependent inhibition of vasopressin release. Therefore, in the neurohypophysis, an osmoregulatory system involving pituicytes, taurine, and GlyRs is operating to control Ca(2+) influx in and neurohormone release from nerve terminals. This elucidates the functional role of glial taurine in the neurohypophysis, reveals the expression of GlyRs on axon terminals, and further defines the role of glial cells in the regulation of neuroendocrine function.",J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,21,18,7110-6,2025-11-04 11:03:11,2025-11-04 11:03:11

In order to predict whether populations are able to persist or adapt to such new conditions, it is essential to understand the molecular basis of such adaptations, which ultimately get translated into these physiological responses. To explore variation in population gene expression across time and space, we investigated transcriptome-level profiles of the calanoid copepod Temora longicornis, that were collected at four different locations in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) on three different time points (April, June, October) in 2018. RNA-seq analysis of field collected adults identified large seasonal differences in gene expression, mainly between spring-summer and autumn samples. The largest log-fold changes occurred in a set of genes encoding for ribosomal and myosin (heavy chain) transcripts. Enrichment analysis revealed a strong seasonal pattern in vitellogenin, cuticle and glycolytic gene expression as well. We also found a positive correlation between vitellogenin expression and densities of T. longicornis. No clear spatial variation in expression patterns was found in the BPNS.

In papain, the side chain of Gln19 forms one of the hydrogen-bond donors in the putative oxyanion hole, and its contribution to transition-state stabilization has been evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of Gln19 to Ala caused a decrease in kcat/KM for hydrolysis of CBZ-Phe-Arg-MCA, which is 7700 M-1 s-1 in the mutant enzyme as compared to 464,000 M-1 s-1 in wild-type papain. With a Gln19Ser variant, the activity is even lower, with a kcat/KM value of 760 M-1 s-1. The 60- and 600-fold decreases in kcat/KM correspond to changes in free energy of catalysis of 2.4 and 3.8 kcal/mol for Gln19Ala and Gln19Ser, respectively. In both cases, the decrease in activity is in large part attributable to a decrease in kcat, while KM values are only slightly affected. These results indicate that the oxyanion hole is operational in the papain-catalyzed hydrolysis of CBZ-Phe-Arg-MCA and constitute the first direct evidence of a mechanistic requirement for oxyanion stabilization in the transition state of reactions catalyzed by cysteine proteases. The equilibrium constants Ki for inhibition of the papain mutants by the aldehyde Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO have also been determined. Contrary to the results with the substrate, mutation at position 19 of papain has a very small effect on binding of the inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Biochemistry,Biochemistry,30,37,8924-8,2025-11-04 11:03:13,2025-11-04 11:03:13

Understanding why some particles are ingested and digested, whereas others are not, is important for many fields of research, e.g. survival of pathogens in single-celled organisms or establishment of endosymbiotic relationships. We offered T. pyriformis synthetical bovine-serum-albumin (BSA)-methacrylate microparticles of approximately 5.5 μm diameter and studied the ciliates' ingestion and digestion behaviour. Different staining techniques as well as co-feeding with a transformant strain of Escherichia coli revealed that T. pyriformis considers these particles as natural food source and shows no feeding preference. Further, they are ingested at normal rates and may serve as sole food source. A pivotal advantage of these particles is the convenient modification of their surface by binding different ligands resulting in defined surface properties. Ingestion rate of modified microparticles either increased (additional BSA, enzymes) or decreased (amino acids). Furthermore, we investigated glycosylation patterns by lectin binding. By binding different substances to the surface in combination with various staining techniques, we provide a versatile experimental tool for elucidating details on food recognition and digestion that may allow to study evading digestion by pathogens or potential endosymbionts, too.",Eur J Protistol,European journal of protistology,52,N/A,45-57,2025-11-04 11:03:15,2025-11-04 11:03:15

In this study about three hundred measurements, carried out on apples in Northern-Central Italy and recently published, are examined, with the purpose of defining the main characteristics of value statistical distribution and variability and to optimize sampling criteria. The analysis did not indicate the presence of significantly high levels or consequently significantly high risks; nevertheless, it pointed out some important aspects in data collection and evaluation. First, it appeared that the statistical distribution of data is typically nonsymmetrical, non-Gaussian, and characterized by a tail extending toward the high values. The logarithmic transformation of data appeared useful in order to obtain a Gaussian distribution. As a rule, the data variability appeared to be high. The frequency and distribution of values above the analytical threshold resulted in significant change, both in time and in space. The percentage of positive values (above the analytical threshold) appeared to vary up to a factor of 2-3, as analogously did their geometric mean.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,16,2,143-7,2025-11-04 11:03:17,2025-11-04 11:03:17

The concept of metabolic dysfunction as an important underlying mechanism in HF is well established. Cardiac function is inextricably linked to metabolism, with dysregulation of cardiac metabolism pathways implicated in a range of cardiac complications, including HF. Modulation of cardiac metabolism has therefore become an attractive clinical target. Cardiac metabolism is based on the integration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and utilization pathways. ATP itself impacts the heart not only by providing energy, but also represents a central element in the purinergic signaling pathway, which has received considerable attention in recent years. Furthermore, novel drugs that have received interest in HF include angiotensin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, whose favorable cardiovascular profile has been at least partly attributed to their effects on metabolism. This review, describes the major metabolic pathways and concepts of the healthy heart (including fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis, Krebs cycle, Randle cycle, and purinergic signaling) and their dysregulation in the progression to HF (including ketone and amino acid metabolism). The cardiac implications of HF comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus and cachexia are also discussed.

As typical temporary wetland inhabitants, large branchiopods rely on bet hedging hatching that helps them survive throughout generations. An optimal hatching rate is predicted to be approximate to the successful reproduction probability (SRP). We tested the difference between hatching rate and SRP of large branchiopods Branchinella kugenumaensis and Eulimnadia braueriana in a temporary wetland in Taiwan, through field surveys and climatic records to evaluate their SRP. Comparisons were performed under two proposed scenarios, where a population's hatching was bet hedged for a hydroperiod or for a wet season (with several hydroperiods), respectively. Population size fluctuations were simulated for these two scenarios under assumed egg mortalities and reproductive replenishments. Results showed that the hatching rates only fitted to SRP for E. braueriana under the scenario of bet hedging on a wet season, not for B. kugenumaensis, nor for both species under the scenario of bet hedging on a hydroperiod. Bet hedging on a wet season would have a smaller range of population size fluctuation and a lower rate of population size decrease. This implies that large branchiopods adopt a conservative hatching strategy, lowering the hatching fraction in each hydroperiod to reduce long-term egg bank size fluctuation. Bet hedging strategies could occur during other life cycle stages, coexist with other life history strategies, and lead to the diversified hatching fraction distribution rather than a single, optimal fraction throughout hydroperiods.",Oecologia,Oecologia,188,4,1081-1093,2025-11-04 11:03:24,2025-11-04 11:03:24

Preoperative bone-window computed tomography was used to classify IAM changes into extensive destruction (17%), widening (46%), and normal IAM (36%). Extensive destruction (47 +/- 19 years) and widening (48 +/- 13) occurred in significantly younger patients than normal IAM (59 +/- 9). Preoperative hearing was significantly more severely disturbed in patients with extensive destruction than in those with widening or normal IAM. IAM change was significantly related to the tumor consistency, as normal IAM was more common in patients with cystic tumor than in those with solid tumor. Postoperative hearing and facial function were worse in patients with severe IAM change, although the relationship between the IAM change and the surgical result was not significant. One patient with extensive destruction developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage through the air cells around the IAM, and needed surgical repair. Severe IAM change occurs with solid tumor and causes severely disturbed preoperative hearing in younger patients, which reflects the tumor aggressiveness. Severe IAM change increases the technical difficulty of tumor removal and the risk of postoperative CSF leakage, and is associated with a poorer prognosis for patients with vestibular schwannoma.",Neurol Med Chir (Tokyo),Neurologia medico-chirurgica,42,11,465-70; discussion 470-1,2025-11-04 11:03:24,2025-11-04 11:03:24

We have previously shown that the nuclear hormone receptor CAR (Constitutive Androstane Receptor, NR113) mediates the well studied induction of CYP2B10 gene expression by phenobarbital (PB) and 1, 4-bis-[2-(3, 5,-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP). We have used the CAR knockout mouse model to explore the broader functions of this xenobiotic receptor. In addition to the liver, CAR is expressed in the epithelial cells of the villi in the small intestine, and this expression is required for CYP2B10 induction in response to PB and TCPOBOP in those cells. In agreement with previous observations that CAR can bind to regulatory elements in CYP3A genes, CAR is also required for induction of expression of CYP3A11 in response to both PB and TCPOBOP in liver. In males, CAR is also required for induction of liver CYP2A4 expression. In wild type animals, pretreatment with the CAR inverse agonist androstenol blocks the response of both the CYP2B10 and CYP3A11 genes to PB and TCPOBOP, and decreases basal CYP3A11 expression. CAR is also required for the response of CYP2B10 to several additional xenobiotic inducers, including chlorpromazine, clotrimazole and dieldrin, but not dexamethasone, an agonist for both the xenobiotic receptor PXR (Pregnane X Receptor NR112) and the glucocorticoid receptor. Chlorpromazine induction of CYP3A11 is also absent in CAR-deficient animals, but the responses to clotrimazole and dieldrin are retained, indicating that both of these inducers can also activate PXR (Pregnane X Receptor NR112). We conclude that CAR has broad functions in xenobiotic responses. Some are specific to CAR but others, including induction of the important drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, overlap with those of PXR.",Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,2,2,117-26,2025-11-04 11:03:25,2025-11-04 11:03:25

Using a combined fMRI and tract-based spatial statistics approach, we investigated the relation of microstructural asymmetries in language-relevant white matter pathways and functional activation asymmetries during silent verb generation and passive listening to spoken words. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed several leftward asymmetric clusters in the arcuate fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus that were differentially related to activation asymmetries in the two functional tasks. Frontal and temporal activation asymmetries during silent verb generation were positively related to the strength of specific microstructural white matter asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus. In contrast, microstructural uncinate fasciculus asymmetries were related to temporal activation asymmetries during passive listening. These findings suggest that white matter asymmetries may indeed be one of the factors underlying functional hemispheric asymmetries.

In both populations, call and tuning characters correlated negatively with body size; females were larger than males and their BPs were tuned to a lower frequency. Analysis of covariance showed that neither the sex difference in tuning nor the population differences in calls or tuning were due to the difference in body size alone, but instead represented differences in the allometric relationships of each character with body size. The analysis implied that differences between sexes or populations were due more to shifts in the Y-intercept rather than the slope of the relationship with body size. This suggests a developmental model in which sexes or populations possess resonant structures in the ear or larynx with similar growth rates but different starting points or initial growth phases, resulting in different frequency characteristics as adults. The examination of the relationship between female BP tuning and male call dominant frequency predicts potentially different patterns of sexual selection in the two populations, with the Wimberley population males subject to much greater directional selection for low frequency calls.",Brain Behav Evol,"Brain, behavior and evolution",39,4,238-46,2025-11-04 11:03:30,2025-11-04 11:03:30

Among these criteria, the study found that entertainment was the most significant, while privacy was the least significant. Findings suggested that likes, comments, and followers were the biggest contributors to poor mental health (total utility = 56.24). The least effective feature was 'games' (total utility = 2.56). The researcher recommends that social media users be cautious when interacting with social media features, especially likes, comments, followers, media, and posts, because of their significant effect on mental health.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,20,3,N/A,2025-11-04 11:03:33,2025-11-04 11:03:33

Reaction of 1 with sodium hydrosulfite affords the 1,4-reduced product, 3-piperidinylcarbonyl-1,2,4-trimethyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline (), with low enantioselectivity, whereas sodium borohydride promotes 1,2-reduction, affording 3-piperidinylcarbonyl-1,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline () as the sole product in a moderate enantioselectivity. When 1 was reduced by the chiral NADH model compound, 2,4-dimethyl-3-(N-alpha-methylbenzylcarbamoyl)-1-propyl-1,4-dihydropyridine (Me(2)PNPH (4)), the regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the reaction were significantly altered by the stereochemistry of 1 and 4.

Our longitudinal studies showed that inflammatory changes first appear in the cecum, ascending and transverse colon of 3-wk-old mutants. As the disease progressed, lesions appeared in the remainder of the colon and in the rectum. Some aged IL-10-/- mice also developed inflammation in the small intestine. Prolonged disease with transmural lesions and a high incidence of colorectal adenocarcinomas (60%) was observed in 6-mo-old mutants. Mechanistic studies have associated uncontrolled cytokine production by activated macrophages and CD4+ Th1-like T cells with the enterocolitis exhibited by IL-10-/- mice. A major role for a pathogenic Th1 response was further suggested by showing that anti-IFNgamma antibody (Ab) treatment significantly attenuated intestinal inflammation in young IL-10-/- mice. When weanlings were treated with IL-10, they failed to develop any signs of intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, IL-10 treatment of adults was not curative but did ameliorate disease progression. Our studies have also shown that inheritable factors strongly influence the disease susceptibility of IL-10-/- mice.

Remarkably, cone snails can rapidly switch between distinct venoms in response to predatory or defensive stimuli. Here, we show that the defence-evoked venom of Conus geographus contains high levels of paralytic toxins that potently block neuromuscular receptors, consistent with its lethal effects on humans. In contrast, C. geographus predation-evoked venom contains prey-specific toxins mostly inactive at human targets. Predation- and defence-evoked venoms originate from the distal and proximal regions of the venom duct, respectively, explaining how different stimuli can generate two distinct venoms. A specialized defensive envenomation strategy is widely evolved across worm, mollusk and fish-hunting cone snails.

However, although the trends relative to cancer incidence, mortality, and 5-year survival for the nation as a whole have significantly improved, data reveal that there are significant disparities in the degree to which the burden of cancer that remains is borne by racial and ethnic minority population groups. As a practice-oriented discipline grounded in research, nursing could have a dominant role in efforts aimed toward eliminating the cancer disparities experienced by racial and ethnic population groups. Several reports of nursing studies have been published in the peer-reviewed literature that address factors associated with the cancer disparities experienced between and among U.S. racial and ethnic minority groups.

The extracellular space of the CNS along with its subdomains plays a crucial role in the function and stability of the CNS. In this review, we have focused on two components of the neuronal extracellular environment, which are important in regulating CNS plasticity including the extracellular matrix (ECM) and myelin. The ECM consists of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and tenascins, which are organized into unique structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs associate with the neuronal cell body and proximal dendrites of predominantly parvalbumin-positive interneurons, forming a robust lattice-like structure. These developmentally regulated structures are maintained in the adult CNS and enhance synaptic stability. After injury, however, CSPGs and tenascins contribute to the structure of the inhibitory glial scar, which actively prevents axonal regeneration. Myelin sheaths and mature adult oligodendrocytes, despite their important role in signal conduction in mature CNS axons, contribute to the inhibitory environment existing after injury. As such, unlike the peripheral nervous system, the CNS is unable to revert to a ""developmental state"" to aid neuronal repair. Modulation of these external factors, however, has been shown to promote growth, regeneration, and functional plasticity after injury. This review will highlight some of the factors that contribute to or prevent plasticity, sprouting, and axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury.",Neural Plast,Neural plasticity,2018,N/A,2952386,2025-11-04 11:03:43,2025-11-04 11:03:43

Cyclin G2 is an unconventional cyclin that acts to oppose cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of the cyclin G2 gene (CCNG2) in a variety of human cancers has been reported; however, the role of cyclin G2 in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of cyclin G2 in EOC. In vitro and in vivo studies using several EOC-derived tumor cell lines revealed that cyclin G2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and spheroid formation, as well as tumor formation and invasion. By interrogating cDNA microarray data sets, we found that CCGN2 mRNA is reduced in several large cohorts of human ovarian carcinoma when compared with normal ovarian surface epithelium or borderline tumors of the ovary. Mechanistically, cyclin G2 was found to suppress epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by the differential regulation of various EMT genes, such as Snail, Slug, vimentin and E-cadherin. Moreover, cyclin G2 potently suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by downregulating key Wnt components, namely LRP6, DVL2 and β-catenin, which could be linked to inhibition of EMT. Taken together, our novel findings demonstrate that cyclin G2 has potent tumor-suppressive effects in EOCs by inhibiting EMT through attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",Oncogene,Oncogene,35,36,4816-27,2025-11-04 11:03:45,2025-11-04 11:03:45

However, conventional solvent extraction involves the excessive use of organic solvents, costly equipment, and tedious operation. These limitations of conventional extraction methods could be prospectively overcome by the carotenoid-pectin hydrocolloidal complexation. The complexation of lycopene and pectin was efficiently promoted in an aqueous environment, resulting in the colloidal complexes that can be subsequently recovered by sedimentation or centrifugation. In this study, the potential of carotenoid-pectin complexation on tomato pomace containing carotenoids and pectin was evaluated. Tomato pomace is a rich source of lycopene, β-carotene as well as pectin, making it suitable as the raw material for the carotenoid extraction. The extraction of carotenoid and pectin from tomato pomace was optimized using response surface methodology. The maximum recovery was 9.43 mg carotenoid fractions/100 g tomato pomace, while the purity of carotenoid-rich fractions was 92%.

Animal protection was assessed just as a public interest in contrast to the constitutional rights of religious and professional freedom. However this can not be kept up any more as it is aimed to integrate animal protection into the German constitutional law. The authorities now have the duty to investigate each request for ritual slaughter carefully. This investigation must include a close look at the compelling religious reasons, the expert knowledge of the applicant (which includes stunning methods), the local facilities of the slaughterhouse and which is more for whom the meat is for. It is also important whether the animal is slaughtered for sacrificial or commercial reasons. Furthermore the consequences which threaten the religious community, if their members don't live according to the rules, have to be shown. Electric stunning and the fact that it is accepted by Islamic authorities has also to be pointed out. It seems to be possible to turn down a request for ritual slaughter referring that to the fact that animal protection is aimed to be part of the constitutional law.",Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr,DTW.

In order to study the diversity of Agaricomycotina in forest soils, we designed primers targeting the more alignable 28S (LSU) gene, which should be more useful for phylogenetic analyses of the detected taxa. This paper compares the performance of the established ITS1F/4B primer pair, which targets basidiomycetes, to that of two new pairs. Key factors in the comparison were the diversity covered, off-target amplification, rarefaction at different Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) cutoff levels, sensitivity of the method used to process the alignment to missing data and insecure positional homology, and the congruence of monophyletic clades with OTU assignments and BLAST-derived OTU names. The ITS primer pair yielded no off-target amplification but also exhibited the least fidelity to the expected phylogenetic groups. The LSU primers give complementary pictures of diversity, but were more sensitive to modifications of the alignment such as the removal of difficult-to align stretches. The LSU primers also yielded greater numbers of singletons but also had a greater tendency to produce OTUs containing sequences from a wider variety of species as judged by BLAST similarity. We introduced some new parameters to describe alignment heterogeneity based on Shannon entropy and the extent and contents of the OTUs in a phylogenetic tree space. Our results suggest that ITS should not be used when calculating phylogenetic trees from genetically distant sequences obtained from environmental DNA extractions and that it is inadvisable to define OTUs on the basis of very heterogeneous alignments.",PLoS One,PloS one,7,2,e32139,2025-11-04 11:03:51,2025-11-04 11:03:51

Pertuzumab, a HER2 dimerization inhibitor, showed prolonged progression-free survival when used with trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining T-DM1 and pertuzumab on xenografted gastric tumors. T-DM1 as a single agent showed significant antitumor activity in all the three HER2-high expression tumor models tested (NCI-N87, SCH and 4-1ST) but was ineffective against two HER2-low expression tumors (SNU-16 and MKN-28). Using the T-DM1-sensitive NCI-N87 model, the combination efficacy of T-DM1 and pertuzumab was elucidated. The combination induced significant tumor regression, whereas T-DM1 or pertuzumab alone did not. In cultured NCI-N87 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin-α, concomitant treatment of T-DM1 and pertuzumab significantly inhibited proliferation and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared to either agent alone. Only the combination significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3, and its downstream factor AKT. Suppressed HER3 phosphorylation by the combination was also seen in the NCI-N87 xenografted tumors. Compared to single agent treatments, the combination treatment significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against NCI-N87 cells. These findings suggest that T-DM1 in combination with pertuzumab shows significant antitumor activity by increasing AKT signal inhibition and ADCC in HER2-positive gastric cancers.",Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,30,3,1087-93,2025-11-04 11:03:52,2025-11-04 11:03:52

Case-based problems were developed by faculty members to facilitate student problem solving and discussion. Voluntary student enrollment was available during the first week of a semester. Tutorials took place during out of class time and were facilitated by peers from the previous class. Tutors were selected for their outstanding performance in physiology; they were provided with training in facilitation skills and were given a package of model answers. Sixty-eight students enrolled in this pilot program and were organized into groups of approximately 8 students. On average, students attended four of six tutorials. Posttutorial quiz scores were significantly greater than paired pretest scores. Surveys showed that students had high expectations at the outset, which were matched with positive perceptions at the end of the tutorial program; the use of near-peer tutors was especially well received.

In this paper I present an original and principled account of the moral distinction between killing and letting die. The account provides both an explanation of the moral distinction and an explanation for why the distinction does not always hold. If these explanations are correct, the moral distinction between killing and letting die must be taken seriously in medical contexts. Defeasibly, when an agent kills she takes responsibility, but when an agent lets die she does not take responsibility. Therein lies the moral distinction between killing and letting die. The distinction, however, is defeated when an agent is already responsible for the surrounding situation. In such cases, killing does not involve taking any further responsibility and letting die does not avoid taking any responsibility. Medical examples are frequently complicated because patients' autonomous choices impact upon medical practitioners' surrounding responsibility.",Bioethics,Bioethics,22,5,278-85,2025-11-04 11:03:55,2025-11-04 11:03:55

Studies to date, however, have not considered the possible role of progestins in this behavior. As one approach to this question, the autoradiographic method was used to investigate the distribution of progestin-concentrating cells in the brain of the adult male zebra finch (Poephila guttata) after injection of the radiolabeled synthetic progestin [17 alpha-methyl-3H]-promegestone. In the telencephalon, identifiable groups of progestin-accumulating cells were found in the hyperstriatum dorsale, at the medial edge of the lobus parolfactorius, and in the medial septum. In the diencephalon, labeled groups of cells were found in the preoptic area, through much of the medial hypothalamus--including nucleus periventricularis magnocellularis, nucleus medialis hypothalami posterialis, and area infundibularis--and in the medial spiriform nucleus and dorsomedial thalamus. In the myelencephalon, labeled cells are described at the dorsal edge of the medulla and scattered lateral to nXII. These findings offer no support for the hypothesis that progestin acts on any of the known song regions, but do suggest areas of progestin action in the avian central nervous system outside of the known song system.

Participants included students and staff from six middle schools in three states. Formative assessment with students and school staff was conducted in the spring of 2003 to inform the development of school foodservice policy changes. Thirteen potential policy goals were delineated. These formed the basis for the environmental change pilot intervention implemented during the winter/spring of 2004. Questionnaires were used to assess the extent to which the 13 foodservice goals were achieved. Success was defined as achieving 75% of goals not met at baseline. Daily data were collected on goal achievement using the schools' daily food production and sales records. Qualitative data were also collected after the pilot study to obtain feedback from students and staff. Formative research with staff and students identified potential environmental changes. Most schools made substantial changes in the National School Lunch Program meal and snack bar/a la carte offerings. Vending goals were least likely to be achieved. Only one school did not meet the 75% goal achievement objective. Based on the objective data as well as qualitative feedback from student focus groups and interviews with students and school staff, healthful school foodservice changes in the cafeteria and snack bar can be implemented and were acceptable to the staff and students.

A high myopic eye of a 39-year-old Japanese male patient, and a moderate myopic eye of a 47-years old Caucasian female patient were evaluated with OCT, OCTA, and visual field testing for peripapillary pits and spatially corresponding localized visual field defects. In the Japanese patient a temporal and in the Caucasian patient an inferotemporal peripapillary pit was confirmed, both spatially associated with a myopic peripapillary atrophy area. In both cases, the retinal nerve fibers herniated into the pit. En face OCT and OCTA revealed retinal nerve fiber bundle defects and reduced vessel density in the corresponding areas, both projecting to the pit. The visual field showed localized scotomas spatially corresponding to the nerve fiber bundle/OCTA defects in both patients. The visual field defect was a progressing (extending and deepening) paracentral scotoma in the Japanese patient, and a localized superior paracentral and superior arcuate scotoma in the Caucasian patient. Our cases show that peripapillary pits occurring in both Japanese and white European eyes can cause localized retinal nerve fiber bundle and OCTA damage and visual field defects of which some can worsen during the follow-up.

The present report provides the first anatomical localization and characterization of PACAP receptors in the developing human cerebellum. RT-PCR analysis from 15-week-old fetuses to 22-year-old subject showed that PAC1-R and VPAC1-R are expressed in the cerebellum at all stages, whereas VPAC2-R mRNA was barely detectable. In situ hybridization labeling indicated that, in human fetuses, PAC1-R mRNA is associated with the external granule cell layer (EGL), a germinative neuroepithelium, and with the internal granule cell layer (IGL). The distribution pattern of VPAC1-R mRNA was very similar to that of PAC1-R mRNA, whereas VPAC2-R mRNA was visualized only in 7-22-year-old subjects. The localization of [(125)I]PACAP27 binding sites was fully consistent with the distribution of PAC1-R and VPAC1-R mRNA. Pharmacological characterization revealed that, in the EGL and IGL from 15-24-week-old fetuses and in the granule cell layer from 7-22-year-old patients, binding sites exhibit a PAC1-R profile. In contrast, PACAP binding sites observed in the molecular layer and medulla of the adult cerebellum consisted of a heterogeneous population of PAC1-R and VPAC(1/2)-R. Altogether, these data provide the first evidence that PACAP receptors are expressed in the human cerebellar cortex. PAC1-R is the predominant PACAP receptor found in fetuses, and both PAC1-R and VPAC1-R are expressed in the mature cerebellum. These observations suggest that PACAP has neurodevelopmental functions in the human cerebellum.",J Comp Neurol,The Journal of comparative neurology,496,4,468-78,2025-11-04 11:04:02,2025-11-04 11:04:02

Detailed findings on the burden of hypertension are presented in this paper. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in 3727 participants. The age-standardised prevalence of hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mmHg) was 33.2% (95% CI 30.9-35.6%). Hypertension was more frequent in males than females (36.9% vs 29.9%), alcohol drinkers than non-drinkers (40.9% vs 31.6%), overweight than non-overweight (41.5% vs 30.7%) and increased with increasing age (21.4% in 25-34 years old vs 59.2% in 55-64 years old). Three-quarters of the participants said they never had their BP measured before and 94.9% of those with hypertension said they were not aware that they had such a medical problem. High prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors calls for the implementation of primary healthcare approaches such as the WHO package for essential non-communicable diseases to promote healthy lifestyles, early detection, treatment and control.",Int Health,International health,4,4,246-52,2025-11-04 11:04:05,2025-11-04 11:04:05

A longitudinal population-based study.,"Data from a longitudinal study of childhood factors influencing the development of chronic obstructive lung disease were used to assess the effects of asthma on lung function development in male and female children. A population-based cohort of 602 white children, initially aged 5 to 9 yr, was observed prospectively for 13 yr. Spirometry was performed and a standardized respiratory and illness questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers on a yearly basis. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75) were used as measures of lung function. The total number of children reporting asthma over the course of the study was 67. Male asthmatic subjects (n = 42) had larger average percentage of predicted FVC than nonasthmatic males (n = 277). Female asthmatic subjects (n = 23) had a lower average percentage of predicted FEV1 than nonasthmatic females (n = 260). In a multivariate analysis of the individual lung function measures, adjusting for previous level of pulmonary function, age, height, change in height, and personal and maternal smoking, males reporting active asthma had a significantly larger FVC than males with no history of asthma. In contrast, females with active asthma had a significantly smaller FEV1 than females with no history of asthma. Both males and females with active asthma had decreased FEF25-75. From our analysis, we would predict that a female who develops asthma at age 7 would experience a 5% reduction in FEV1 by age 10 and a 7% deficit by age 15.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Am Rev Respir Dis,The American review of respiratory disease,145,1,58-64,2025-11-04 11:04:06,2025-11-04 11:04:06

A careful analysis of the DH lines indicated the integration of the genes of interest [phytoene synthase (psy) and phytoene desaturase (crtI)] and the selectable marker gene (hygromycin phosphotransferase, hph) in two unlinked loci. During subsequent crossing, progenies could be obtained carrying only the locus with psy and crtI, which was segregated independently from the locus containing the hph gene during meiotic segregation. The NIILs (BC(2)F(2)) showed maximum similarity with the recurrent parent cultivar IR64. Further, progenies of two NIILs were devoid of any fragments beyond the left or right border, including the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) antibiotic resistance gene of the transformation vector. Spectrophotometric readings showed the accumulation of up to 1.06 microg total carotenoids, including beta-carotene, in 1 g of the endosperm.

The records of patients with lumbar spinal TB and severe kyphosis treated with 2-stage surgery at our hospital from 2005 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures were kyphosis correction rate, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) spinal cord injury and sensation function scores. A total of 53 patients (34 male, 19 female; mean age 32 years) were included. The number of involved kyphosis segments ranged from 7 to 14, and the average preoperative kyphosis angle was 107.3 ± 18.1°. All procedures were performed without serious complications. The average follow-up time was 42 months. Bone fusion occurred at a range of 6 to 9 months after surgery, and none of the patients had internal fixation failure, position change, or pseudoarthrosis. The mean postoperative kyphosis angle was 29.4 ± 12.4°, with a mean improvement of 77.9°, and the correction rate was 72.6% (P < 0.001). At final follow-up, average correction loss was 1.35°.

This motion aftereffect likely arises across several visual areas from adaptive changes in the balance of activity and competitive interactions. We examined whether or not the mouse was susceptible to this same illusion to determine whether it would be a suitable model for learning about the neural representation of the motion aftereffect. Under a classical conditioning paradigm, mice learned to lick when presented with motion in one direction and not the opposite direction. When the mice were adapted to motion preceding this test, their lick behavior for zero coherence motion was biased for motion in the opposite direction of the adapting stimulus. Overall, lick count versus motion coherence shifted in the opposite direction of the adapting stimulus. This suggests that although the mouse has a simpler visual system compared with primates, it still is subject to the motion aftereffect and may elucidate the underlying circuitry.",eNeuro,eNeuro,5,6,N/A,2025-11-04 11:04:12,2025-11-04 11:04:12

Not all guide RNAs have been successful, and even those that were, varied widely in their efficacy. Here we describe and validate a strategy for Caenorhabditis elegans that reliably achieved a high frequency of genome editing for all targets tested in vivo. The key innovation was to design guide RNAs with a GG motif at the 3' end of their target-specific sequences. All guides designed using this simple principle induced a high frequency of targeted mutagenesis via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and a high frequency of precise DNA integration from exogenous DNA templates via homology-directed repair (HDR). Related guide RNAs having the GG motif shifted by only three nucleotides showed severely reduced or no genome editing. We also combined the 3' GG guide improvement with a co-CRISPR/co-conversion approach. For this co-conversion scheme, animals were only screened for genome editing at designated targets if they exhibited a dominant phenotype caused by Cas9-dependent editing of an unrelated target. Combining the two strategies further enhanced the ease of mutant recovery, thereby providing a powerful means to obtain desired genetic changes in an otherwise unaltered genome.",Genetics,Genetics,199,4,959-71,2025-11-04 11:04:13,2025-11-04 11:04:13

In particular, it is essential to decrease the emissions of toxic gases and smoke particles generated during the thermal decomposition of epoxy resin (EP) to satisfy the industrial requirements for environmental protection and safety. Consequently, the PZS@ZIF-67 composite was designed and synthesized by employing the hydroxyl group-containing polyphosphazene (poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone), PZS) as both the interfacial compatibility and an in situ template and the ZIF-67 nanocrystal as a nanoscale coating and flame-retardant cooperative. ZIF-67 nanocrystal with multidimensional nanostructures was uniformly wrapped on the surface of PZS microspheres. Subsequently, the acquired PZS@ZIF-67 composite was incorporated into the epoxy resin to prepare composite samples for the study of their fire safety, toxicity suppression, and mechanical performance. Herein, the EP/5% PZS@ZIF-67 passed the V-0 rating in a UL-94 test with a 31.9% limit oxygen index value. More precisely, it is endowed with a decline of 51.08%, 28.26%, and 37.87% of the peak heat release rate, the total heat release, and the total smoke production, respectively.

Protocol 2: single-blind randomized trial in 18 athletes with T1D, testing a pre-exercise CHO supplement of 0.7 g CHO·kg(- 1) (n=10) or 0.35 g CHO·kg(- 1) (n=8). The results showed that T1D athletes consumed a lower quantity of CHO than athletes without diabetes at their usual breakfast and during the meal taken<1 h after the competition, but no differences were found in the supplement taken before the competition. In the randomized study, athletes consuming the higher dose of CHO (0.7 g CHO·kg(- 1)) showed increased glycemic levels, comparing with the lower dose (0.35 g CHO·kg(- 1)). In conclusion, athletes with T1D seem to increase CHO intake prior to the competition consuming similar amounts to those athletes without diabetes, but consuming smaller quantities of CHO than the recommended amounts.

The CCR7 and CCR2 chemokine ligands are required for both T cell sequestration in LN and thymic T cell egress following FTY720 administration.

Three U(vi)/ox complexes (UO(2)ox(j)((2-2j)+) with j = 1, 2, 3) were identified in this temperature range. The formation constants and the molar enthalpies of complexation were determined by spectrophotometry and calorimetry. The complexation of uranium(vi) with oxalate ion is exothermic at lower temperatures (10-40 degrees C) and becomes endothermic at higher temperatures (55-70 degrees C). In spite of this, the free energy of complexation becomes more negative at higher temperatures due to increasingly more positive entropy of complexation that exceeds the increase of the enthalpy of complexation. The thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures, in conjunction with the literature data for other dicarboxylic acids, provide insight into the relative strength of U(vi) complexes with a series of dicarboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic and oxydiacetic) and rationalization for the highest stability of U(vi)/oxalate complexes in the series.

Detoxification of free haem is a special challenge for ticks, which digest haemoglobin intracellularly. Ticks lack a haem catabolic mechanism, mediated by haem oxygenase, and need to dispose of vast majority of acquired haem via its accumulation in haemosomes. The knowledge of individual molecules involved in the maintenance of haem homeostasis in ticks is still rather limited. RNA-seq analyses of the Ixodes ricinus midguts from blood- and serum-fed females identified an abundant transcript of glutathione S-transferase (gst) to be substantially up-regulated in the presence of red blood cells in the diet. Here, we have determined the full sequence of this encoding gene, ir-gst1, and found that it is homologous to the delta-/epsilon-class of GSTs. Phylogenetic analyses across related chelicerates revealed that only one clear IrGST1 orthologue could be found in each available transcriptome from hard and soft ticks. These orthologues create a well-supported clade clearly separated from other ticks' or mites' delta-/epsilon-class GSTs and most likely evolved as an adaptation to tick blood-feeding life style. We have confirmed that IrGST1 expression is induced by dietary haem(oglobin), and not by iron or other components of host blood. Kinetic properties of recombinant IrGST1 were evaluated by model and natural GST substrates. The enzyme was also shown to bind haemin in vitro as evidenced by inhibition assay, VIS spectrophotometry, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography. In the native state, IrGST1 forms a dimer which further polymerises upon binding of excessive amount of haemin molecules.

Therefore, the development of effective therapeutic options is an urgent issue for prostate cancer treatment. In this study, we evaluated the effect of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) suppression on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines. In the presence of lithium chloride (LiCl) or SB216763, the GSK-3beta inhibitors, TRAIL-induced cell death was dramatically enhanced, and the enhanced cell death was an augmented apoptotic response evidenced by increased Annexin V labeling and caspase-3 activation. GSK-3beta gene silencing mediated by a small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex also sensitized the cells to TRAIL, confirming the specificity of GSK-3beta suppression. Importantly, TRAIL stimulation increased GSK-3beta tyrosine phosphorylation at Y216, suggesting that GSK-3beta is activated by TRAIL. Furthermore, TRAIL sensitization was associated with increased proteolytic procession of caspase-8 and its downstream target BID, and z-IETD-FMK, the inhibitor specific to active caspase-8 totally blocked LiCl-induced TRAIL sensitization. Finally, Trichodion, a potent nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor, could not affect LiCl-induced TRAIL sensitization, although GSK-3beta inhibitors significantly blocked TRAIL-reduced NF-kappaB activity in prostate cancer cells. These results indicate that GSK-3beta suppression sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis that is dependent on caspase-8 activities but independent of NF-kappaB activation, and suggest that a mechanism involving GSK-3beta activation may be responsible for TRAIL resistance in prostate cancer cells.",Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2,11,1215-22,2025-11-04 11:04:21,2025-11-04 11:04:21

The fracture surface of the conventional large specimen showed a catastrophic cohesive failure in dentin at its center and a lesser adhesive failure, suggesting that the whole failure was due to the development of some major cracks. The non-trimming microtensile test showed significantly larger average bond strength with markedly larger standard deviation and significantly larger fraction of adhesive failure than the conventional test. Some small specimens were extremely strong and some were weak according to the heterogeneous distribution of tight bonding and defective or deficient bonding over the whole dentin surface.

It is shown that depending on the distribution of the extrinsic noise, the master equation yields quantitatively different results compared to using the expectation of the distribution for the stochastic parameter. This difference is incident to the nonlinear terms in the master equation, and we show that the deviation away from the expectation of the extrinsic noise scales nonlinearly with the variance of the distribution. The method presented here converges linearly with respect to the number of particles in the system and exponentially with respect to the order of the polynomials used in the stochastic collocation calculation. This makes the method presented here more accurate than standard Monte Carlo methods, which suffer from slow, nonmonotonic convergence. In epidemiological terms, the results show that extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they effect the speed of disease breakouts and that the gamma distribution should be used to model the basic reproductive number.",Phys Rev E,Physical review.

The apoptosis blocking activity of Mcl-1 is inhibited by BH3-only protein Noxa. We found that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and its derivative X-11 are potent apoptosis inducers in AML cells and act through a Noxa-mediate pathway; X-11 is four-fold more active than DHA. DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis is associated with induction of Noxa; apoptosis is blocked by silencing Noxa.

These differences may account for the variability in the prevalence of hypertension in different groups. The main aim of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in venous responsiveness to the vasoactive agents, phenylephrine and isoproterenol, between Mexican-Americans and White Americans. Isoproterenol is a potent non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine is an alpha1-selective adrenergic agonist. Using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique, dose-response curves were constructed for the two vasoactive agents in 10 Mexican-American and 10 White American volunteers. The maximal venoconstriction for phenylephrine in the Mexican-American group was significantly less than that of the Whites in the study (71.2 +/- 20.1% vs 89.4 +/- 10.9%, P < 0.05). The log ED50 for isoproterenol in the Mexican-American group was also significantly greater than that for Whites (1.68 +/- 0.35[47.6 ng/min] vs 1.19 +/- 0.55[15.5 ng/min], P < 0.05).

We found that gK vaccinated mice had significantly higher HSV-1 titers in their eyes than gD or mock-vaccinated mice and that anti-gK sera enhanced HSV-1 infection in the macrophage cell line U937. In addition, passive transfer of anti-gK sera to naive mice 24 h prior to ocular HSV-1 challenge also increased viral replication. These results were consistent with ADE of HSV-1 by sera to gK.

However, its role in ovarian carcinoma (OC) is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of MIR4435-2HG in OC. We found that both MIR4435-2HG and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) were upregulated in OC. MIR4435-2HG is associated with tumor metastasis but not with tumor size. Upregulation of MIR4435-2HG distinguished early stage (Stage I and II) OC patients from healthy controls. Correlation analysis showed that plasma levels of MIR4435-2HG and TGF-β1 were positively correlated only in OC patients. qPCR and western blot analysis results showed that MIR4435-2HG overexpression led to upregulation of TGF-β1 in OC cells, while TGF-β1 treatment did not significantly affect MIR4435-2HG expression. Transwell invasion and migration assays showed that MIR4435-2HG and TGF-β1 promoted the invasion and migration of OC cells while TGF-β inhibitor suppressed the invasion and migration of these cells.

Despite new chemotherapeutic treatments, the prognosis of gastric cancer remains poor. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is used as a standard chemotherapy drug in gastric cancer. However, 5-FU resistance develops frequently and is a main cause of chemotherapy failure in human gastric cancer. Overexpression of cyclin D1 is related to rapid cell growth, a poor prognosis and increased chemoresistance in several types of cancers. In this study, we investigated whether treatment of gastric cancer cells with shRNA targeting cyclin D1 (ShCCND1) or 5-FU, alone or in combination, influences the activation of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and pNFκB, which are markers that are increased in 5-FU chemoresistance. We also investigated the effect of combined treatment with ShCCND1 and 5-FU on cell growth and chemosensitivity to 5-FU in the gastric cancer cell line AGS. The data showed that ShCCND1-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation in AGS cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, cell mobility and clonogenicity. In addition, combined treatment with ShCCND1 and 5-FU significantly decreased the survival rate of AGS cells, compared to single-treatment with either agent. These results demonstrated that ShCCND1 increases 5-FU chemosensitivity, a conclusion that is also supported by the concomitant reduction in expression of pAKT and pNFκB, increase of G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these data provide further evidence that therapeutic strategies targeting cyclin D1 may have the dual advantage of suppressing the growth of cancer cells, while enhancing their chemosensitivity.",Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,43,6,2007-14,2025-11-04 11:04:35,2025-11-04 11:04:35
11585851,"S A John, J N Weiss, B Ribalet",2001,Regulation of cloned ATP-sensitive K channels by adenine nucleotides and sulfonylureas: interactions between SUR1 and positively charged domains on Kir6.2.,"K(ATP) channels, comprised of the pore-forming protein Kir6.x and the sulfonylurea receptor SURx, are regulated in an interdependent manner by adenine nucleotides, PIP2, and sulfonylureas. To gain insight into these interactions, we investigated the effects of mutating positively charged residues in Kir6.2, previously implicated in the response to PIP2, on channel regulation by adenine nucleotides and the sulfonylurea glyburide. Our data show that the Kir6.2 ""PIP2-insensitive"" mutants R176C and R177C are not reactivated by MgADP after ATP-induced inhibition and are also insensitive to glyburide. These results suggest that R176 and R177 are required for functional coupling to SUR1, which confers MgADP and sulfonylurea sensitivity to the K(ATP) channel. In contrast, the R301C and R314C mutants, which are also ""PIP2-insensitive,"" remained sensitive to stimulation by MgADP in the absence of ATP and were inhibited by glyburide. Based on these findings, as well as previous data, we propose a model of the K(ATP) channel whereby in the presence of ATP, the R176 and R177 residues on Kir6.2 form a specific site that interacts with NBF1 bound to ATP on SUR1, promoting channel opening by counteracting the inhibition by ATP. This interaction is facilitated by binding of MgADP to NBF2 and blocked by binding of sulfonylureas to SUR1. In the absence of ATP, since K(ATP) channels are not blocked by ATP, they do not require the counteracting effect of NBF1 interacting with R176 and R177 to open. Nevertheless, channels in this state remain activated by MgADP. This effect may be explained by a direct stimulatory interaction of NBF2/MgADP moiety with another region of Kir6.2 (perhaps the NH2 terminus), or by NBF2/MgADP still promoting a weak interaction between NBF1 and Kir6.2 in the absence of ATP. The region delimited by R301 and R314 is not involved in the interaction with NBF1 or NBF2, but confers additional PIP2 sensitivity.",J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,118,4,391-405,2025-11-04 11:04:36,2025-11-04 11:04:36

Stimulation using charge balanced biphasic pulses at intensities both within and well above maximum clinical levels for cochlear implants (0.025-0.68 microC per phase), were delivered to platinum electrodes in vitro [saline, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or saline with human serum albumin (HSA)], and in vivo (scala tympani). Stimulus rates were typically varied from 62.5 to 1000 pulses per second (pps), although rates of up to 14,500 pps were used in some experiments. The pH level was recorded using a pH indicator (Phenol red) or pH microelectrodes. While electrical stimulation at intensities and rates used clinically showed no evidence of a pH shift, intensities significantly above these levels induced pH changes both in vitro and in vivo. The extent of pH change was related to stimulus rate and intensity. In addition, pH change was closely associated with the residual direct current (dc) level. As expected, stimulation with capacitive coupling induced little dc and a minimal pH shift. Moreover, no pH shift was observed using alternating leading phase pulse trains at intensities up to 0.68 microC per phase and 1000 pps. Saline with HSA or buffered solutions dramatically reduced the extent of pH shift observed following stimulation in unbuffered inorganic saline.

Although genetic mechanisms governing vertebrate neural development have been investigated in depth, epigenetic regulation of this process remains less understood. Redundancy of epigenetic factors and early lethality of animals deficient in critical epigenetic components pose major challenges in characterization of epigenetic factors in vertebrate neural development. In this study, we use the amphibian model Xenopus laevis to investigate the roles of non-redundant, obligatory components of all histone H3K4 activating methylation complexes (COMPASS, also known as SET1/MLL complexes) in early neural development. The two genes that we focus on, Ash2l and Dpy30, regulate mesendodermal differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and cause early embryonic lethality when removed from mouse embryos. Using targeted knockdown of the genes in dorsal ectoderm of Xenopus that gives rise to future nervous system, we show here that ash2l and dpy30 are required for neural and neural crest marker expression in Xenopus late neurula embryos but are dispensable for early neural and neural plate border gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Dpy30 and Ash2L associate with the neural plate border transcription factors, such as Msx1 and Tfap2a. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay further demonstrates that Ash2L and the H3K4me3 active histone mark accumulate at the promoter regions of the neural crest gene sox10 in a Tfap2a-dependent manner.

All fish were fed 1% daily ration. Measured plasma cortisol levels were highest at day 3 and returned close to normal values by day 30 in cortisol-implanted fish. No plasma cortisol elevation was observed in the sham group. Growth was depressed in the cortisol-treated fish.

Nitrogen excretion, estimated as the sum of ammonia-N plus urea-N excretion, and the nitrogen quotient exhibited small decreases at day 30. Total-N excretion, measured with a nitrogen oxidizer, was approximately twice the sum of ammonia-N plus urea-N excretion but exhibited a similar trend.

11389561,"D Felce, E Emerson",2001,Living with support in a home in the community: predictors of behavioral development and household and community activity.,"The purpose of this article was to review studies of behavioral development and household and community activity among adults with mental retardation living in community residential services and to distill knowledge about the factors that influence outcome. Research points to behavioral development occurring across the full spectrum of disability but influenced by mental retardation syndrome and the acquisition of pivotal skills. However, engagement in household and community activities has been found to be strongly related to individual adaptive behavior. People with more severe mental retardation are vulnerable to leading lives characterized by underoccupation and lack of community involvement. Moving from institutional to community-based residential services may be accompanied by significant increases in adaptive behavior, but a plateau effect on subsequent development has also been reported. There is substantial evidence to suggest that key aspects of effective teaching technology may be absent in community-based residential environments. Community settings support greater engagement in household and community activities than institutions. Ordinary housing stock and normative architecture and standards of material enrichment are to be preferred. The use of normative housing constrains group living to relatively small scale, but there is little evidence that smaller size within this range is to be preferred to larger size. There is little evidence to suggest that higher staff-to-resident ratios lead to uniformly better outcomes, but staff orientation, working methods, and performance are important influences. Little is known about what precise characteristics of community location give rise to greater community integration.

At the Minanga Sipakko site in Sulawesi, preserved leaf and husk phytoliths of rice show the diagnostic morphology of domesticated varieties, and the discarded husks indicate on-site processing of the crops. The phytoliths were contained within an undisturbed, subsurface archaeological layer of red-slipped pottery, a marker for an evidently sudden cultural change in the region that multiple radiocarbon results extend back to 3,500 years ago.

Surrogate genetic testing of a decedent's living brother identified a rare KCNQ1-V133I variant, which prompted an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and subsequent diagnosis of LQTS in other family members. Subsequently, this presumed LQT1 family came to our institution for further clinical evaluation and research-based investigations, including KCNQ1-V133I variant-specific analysis of the decedent, heterologous expression studies of KCNQ1-V133I, and a whole-exome molecular autopsy along with genomic triangulation using his unaffected parents' DNA. After evaluating several V133I-positive family members, clinical doubt was cast on the veracity of the previously levied diagnosis of LQT1, resulting in a re-opening of the case and an intense pursuit of the lethal substrate. Furthermore, the decedent tested negative for V133I, and heterologous expression studies demonstrated a normal cellular phenotype for V133I-containing Kv7.1 channels. Instead, after whole-exome molecular autopsy, a de novo pathogenic variant (p.R454W) in DES-encoded desmin was identified. As detailed herein, the forensic evaluation of sudden death in the young requires meticulous focus on the decedent followed by a careful and deliberate assessment of the decedent's relatives. Surrogate genetic testing can have disastrous consequences and should be avoided. Genetic test results require careful scrutiny to avoid unintended and potentially devastating repercussions. Although the root cause of the decedent's tragic death would have remained a mystery, the unintended consequences for the living relatives described herein might have been avoided based on clinical grounds alone. All family members had electrocardiograms with normal QT intervals, making the diagnosis of familial LQTS unlikely. As such, if the clinicians caring for these patients had focused solely on clinical data from the survivors, there might have been no reason to embark on a path of inappropriate treatment based on genetic testing.",Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,N/A,N/A,N/A,2025-11-04 11:04:50,2025-11-04 11:04:50

Symbolic execution can be used to analyze the paths of the network protocol implementations, but for stateful network protocols, it is difficult to reach the deep states of the protocol. This paper proposes a novel model-guided approach to detect vulnerabilities in network protocol implementations. Our method first abstracts a finite state machine (FSM) model, then utilizes the model to guide the symbolic execution. This approach achieves high coverage of both the code and the protocol states. The proposed method is implemented and applied to test numerous real-world network protocol implementations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is more effective than traditional fuzzing methods such as SPIKE at detecting vulnerabilities in the deep states of network protocol implementations.",PLoS One,PloS one,12,11,e0188229,2025-11-04 11:04:50,2025-11-04 11:04:50
15950475,Shirley Rietdyk,2006,Anticipatory locomotor adjustments of the trail limb during surface accommodation.,"This paper explores anticipatory locomotor adjustments of the trail limb when stepping up to a new level. The kinematics and kinetics of the trail limb for nine subjects were compared across level gait and surface accommodation. The largest generation of new rotational energy was found at the trail ankle, during the latter part of stance (i.e. ankle 'push-off'). Accelerations of the head, arms and trunk (HAT) and foot segments during the same phase indicate that the ankle power acted to push the body and lead limb up onto the new level and drive the foot upwards at toe-off. The shank was more vertical at toe-off to ensure that the ankle energy would drive the limb upwards, rather than forward into the surface. The vertical hip translation energy increased over 300%, acting to pull upwards on the hip to increase trail limb elevation. The increased hip translational energy could be due to extension of the lead limb after it was placed on the surface and/or the piston-like drive of the increased rotational energy at the trail ankle during late stance. The findings add to the knowledge of whole body coordination strategies during anticipatory locomotor adjustments when the entire body is raised to a new level.",Gait Posture,Gait & posture,23,3,268-72,2025-11-04 11:04:52,2025-11-04 11:04:52

Direct sequence comparison of the Tho and Bro proteins reveals complete structural identity in 25 of the N-terminal 27 residues, with unique amino acid substitutions shared at the N-terminus and positions 16, 18, and 24. This remarkable sequence homology suggests that the two VH sequences represent examples of an unblocked VHI sub-subgroup. The Tho and Bro sequences possess an ala-glu-val basic triplet at positions 9 to 11 in common with the other previously reported VHI proteins which help to further establish this sequence triplet as a recognizable VHI subgroup-specific region. Moreover, in this regard, the unblocked sequences of Tho and Bro emphasize the importance of extending an unblocked VHI sequence beyond positions 9 to 11 before a subgroup assignment can be determined.",J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",119,3,847-9,2025-11-04 11:04:52,2025-11-04 11:04:52

Exercise echocardiography and 201Tl SPECT were performed on consecutive days in connection with a standard symptom-limited upright bicycle test and analyzed in a 9-segment model. Coronary angiography was performed in all but 1 patient and 60 patients had significant coronary lesions. Wall motion abnormalities were seen in 53 patients (81%) at rest and perfusion defects in 57 patients (88%) at the redistribution images. New or worsening of wall motion abnormalities were seen in 55 patients, either seated at peak exercise or recumbent after exercise, and 43 patients had reversible or partially reversible 201Tl scintigraphic defects (P = .02). The segmental agreement between wall motion abnormalities and scintigraphic defects was low (58%). The additional value of exercise echocardiography and 201Tl SPECT to exercise test was greatest in patients with one-vessel disease.

In the present report we compared the effects of glucocorticoids on FN expression in cytotrophoblast cultures isolated from human first trimester and term placentas to elucidate potential steroid-dependent cellular mechanisms associated with human parturition. Based on immunoassays, treatment of first trimester cytotrophoblasts with 10(-7) M dexamethasone (DEX) for 2 cr 4 days reduced medium levels of oncofetal FN (onfFN; i.e. FNs bearing an oncofetal epitope) to approximately 80% of control levels. Conversely, treatment of cytotrophoblasts isolated from term placentas with DEX dramatically reduced medium levels of onfFN to approximately 12% of control values. Treatment of both first trimester and term cells with 10(-6) M progestin, mineralocorticoid, or estrogen had no significant effect on onfFN expression in either cell type. Glucocorticoids specifically down-regulated medium levels of onfFN in term cells, but not in first trimester cells. In contrast, DEX treatment promoted an approximately 3- to 7-fold increase in levels of hCG in both first trimester and term cytotrophoblasts, suggesting that the effects of glucocorticoid on FN and hCG expression are elicited through independent cell-signaling pathways. In first trimester cells, DEX promoted a reduction in rates of FN and laminin synthesis to 60-70% of control levels. In term cells, DEX treatment reduced levels of FN and laminin synthesis to approximately 10% of control levels. Similarly, DEX treatment down-regulated levels of FN mRNA to approximately 60% and 10% of control values in first trimester and term cells, respectively. The first trimester of human pregnancy is associated with low levels of glucocorticoids and reduced glucocorticoid responsiveness. These conditions would favor high levels of placental ECM protein synthesis, thus stabilizing uterine-placental adherence. Conversely, elevated levels of glucocorticoids near parturition and increased glucocorticoid responsiveness would inhibit placental ECM protein synthesis, reducing uterine-placental adherence and promoting the separation of placenta from uterus.",Endocrinology,Endocrinology,134,5,2064-71,2025-11-04 11:05:12,2025-11-04 11:05:12

Here PET clearly bridges the gap, as nearly identical imaging protocols can be applied to both animal and humans. However, some hurdles exist and researchers must be careful, partly because the animals are usually anesthetized during the scans, while human volunteers are awake. This review is based on our own experiences of some of the most important pitfalls and how to overcome them. This includes how studies should be designed, how to select the right anesthesia and monitoring. The choice of anesthesia is quite crucial, as it may have a greater influence on the results than the effect of the tested procedures. Monitoring is necessary, as the animals cannot fully maintain homeostasis during anesthesia, and reliable results are dependent on a stable physiology. Additionally, it is important to note that rodents, in particular, are prone to rapidly becoming hypothermic. Thus, the selection of an appropriate anesthetic and monitoring protocol is crucial for both obtaining accurate results and ensuring animal welfare. Prior to imaging, catheters for tracer administration and, if necessary, blood sampling should be implanted. The administration of tracers should be done in a manner that minimizes interference with the scans, and the same applies to any serial blood sampling. The limited blood volume and organ size of rodents should also be taken into consideration when planning experiments. Finally, if the animal needs to be awakened after the scan, proper care must be taken to ensure their welfare.",Semin Nucl Med,Seminars in nuclear medicine,53,5,570-576,2025-11-04 11:05:13,2025-11-04 11:05:13

Inhibition of the RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has proved to be a successful strategy for the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular disorders. However, by reducing feedback inhibition of renin release, the effects of ACE-Is and ARBs lead to an increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC) and activity (PRA), limiting a complete inhibition of the RAS. Consequently the effects of a different pharmacological strategy that completely blocks the RAS upstream has been assessed in the last years. In this context, aliskiren is the first representative of a new class of non-peptide orally active renin inhibitor that blocks the RAS at its rate-limiting step and induces a net reduction in PRA, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. Aliskiren effectively reduces blood pressure as a monotherapy as well in combination therapy. In addition, aliskiren has a placebo-like tolerability profile at the licensed doses of 150 mg and 300 mg. Aliskiren also exhibits additive effects on blood pressure reduction when combined with drugs that lead to a reactive increase in the PRA, such as diuretics, ACE-Is or ARBs. In previous studies, aliskiren showed beneficial effects in patients with arterial hypertension and associated clinical conditions.

In line with the underlying principles of defensive contact-shunning on the one hand, and non-traumatic empathic failure on the other hand, the repetition can be seen as the twofold expression both of the wish for a new benign relationship and of the dread of traumatic, repeated disappointment. Therefore, early non-traumatic disappointments are initiated by the patient, and role-responded to by significant others. This way, the risk of disillusionment of full-blown expectations is avoided. The repetition compulsion, then, is a complex mechanism: preventive in one part, it protects the vulnerable self from potentially traumatising experiences; thus, it is operated in response to the danger signal of emotional cravings, once the latter are experienced as getting out of hand. Providing novel experiences, in its other part, it can lead to opening the road for change; such curative impact relies on lengthy working through in a safe, empathic, holding environment.",Int J Psychoanal,The International journal of psycho-analysis,84,Pt 2,427-41,2025-11-04 11:05:20,2025-11-04 11:05:20

However, it is unclear whether the P301 L mutation increases the formation of the intermediates of tau filaments that are suggested to be a toxic species of tau. To determine the amount and structure of the intermediates harboring with the P301L mutation, we purified recombinant versions of wild-type, P301L, and 4 other mutants (i.e., P301S, P301T, V337M, and R406W) tau proteins and analyzed the heparin-induced aggregation of those tau constructs.

The present study aimed to clarify the potential mechanism underlying the promotion of tumor growth by reduced Cav‑1 expression levels, by investigating Cav‑1‑targeted molecules in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. The expression of growth factors in the ESF fibroblast cell line transfected with Cav‑1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was examined. The expression of apoptotic regulators in the BT474 breast cancer cell line that was co‑cultured with the fibroblasts, was also investigated. The transfection of Cav‑1‑targeting siRNA in ESF cells resulted in efficient and specific inhibition of Cav‑1 expression. The downregulation of Cav‑1 increased the expression and secretion of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast‑specific protein‑1 (FSP‑1) in ESF cells.

Tumor protein 53‑induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) was upregulated in the BT474 cells under the condition of co‑culture with Cav‑1 siRNA fibroblasts, while levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were decreased, resulting in apoptosis inhibition in the breast cancer cells. These results demonstrated that the downregulation of Cav‑1 promoted the growth of breast cancer cells through increasing SDF‑1, EGF and FSP‑1 in tumor stromal fibroblasts, and TIGAR levels in breast cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study supports the hypothesis that Cav‑1 possesses tumor‑suppressor properties, with the mechanism of Cav‑1‑dependent signaling involving the regulation of SDF‑1, EGF, FSP‑1 and TIGAR.",Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,13,1,744-52,2025-11-04 11:05:27,2025-11-04 11:05:27

With only about 1,000 cases reported, there are no clear guidelines regarding management of this disease. Intracranial extension and orbital involvement have been shown to be independent risk factors associated with poorer outcomes. We hereby report a case of a 46-year old male presented with an 8-month history of progressive nasal obstruction and intermittent right-sided epistaxis associated with anosmia and increased pressure sensation in and around the right eye. Further evaluation revealed a large enhancing heterogeneous cystic and solid mass in the right nasal cavity measuring 5.0×5.3×4.6 cm with extension superiorly into the anterior cranial fossa and frontal lobes, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. A biopsy of this mass confirmed high grade olfactory neuroblastoma. Because of the intra-cranial extension, a decision was made to start neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. The patient had very good response to this treatment on a repeat imaging study and went on to have resection of this mass. Post-operatively, he received radiation therapy to the tumor bed and 2 more cycles of chemotherapy.

Here, encapsulation of a vitamin C-loaded gel-like double emulsion using a hydrophobic emulsifier and soy particles was performed to develop a bioactive bioink for 3D printing of highly porous scaffolds with enhanced cell biocompatibility. The produced double emulsions suggested a mechanical strength with the range of elastic moduli of soft tissues possessing a thixotropic feature and recoverable matrix. The outstanding flow behavior and viscoelasticity broaden the potential of gel-like double emulsion to engineer 3D scaffolds, in which 3D constructs showed a high level of porosity and excellent shape fidelity with antiwearing and self-lubricating properties. Investigation of cell viability and proliferation using fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) within vitamin C-loaded gel-like bioinks revealed that printed 3D scaffolds offered brilliant biocompatibility and cell adhesion. Compared to scaffolds without encapsulated vitamin C, 3D scaffolds containing vitamin C showed higher cell viability after 1 week of cell proliferation.

The rate of oxygen consumption was measured in young pigs exposed to different ambient temperatures and the effect on metabolic rate of changing the temperature of thermodes implanted in the hypothalamus and over the spinal cord was determined. In some experiments the temperature of the skin over the trunk was changed by means of a water-perfused coat.2. Cooling the hypothalamus or the spinal cord in a warm ambient did not change the rate of oxygen consumption. At a thermoneutral ambient temperature, cooling either thermode increased oxygen consumption. In a cold environment, cooling either thermode increased the rate of oxygen consumption more than at a thermoneutral temperature. The increase in the rate of oxygen consumption was greatest during cooling of the spinal cord and it appeared that the pigs also shivered more violently. Heating either thermode tended to decrease oxygen consumption in a cold environment.3. In pigs with thermodes both in the hypothalamus and over the spinal cord, cooling both thermodes was accompanied by a greater increase in oxygen consumption than cooling either thermode alone. The increase in oxygen consumption on cooling one thermode could be reduced by heating the other.4.

Due to the strong absorption properties of the chiral selector at the low wavelengths used, the partial-filling countercurrent method was adopted in order to improve method sensitivity. In the separation system studied, the chiral selector filled only a part of the capillary and, due to the appropriate selection of the pH, was moving in the opposite direction of the analytes keeping the detector free from absorbing compounds. The effect of several experimental parameters on the enantioresolution of analytes was studied, e.g., vancomycin concentration (0-5 mM), pH of the background electrolyte (pH 4-7), capillary temperature (15-35 degrees C), and the presence of an organic modifier in the run buffer (methanol or ethanol or n-propanol). N-Acetyl glutamic acid, serine, cystine, tyrosine, and proline were all baseline-resolved into their enantiomers and the enantioresolution factor (R(s)) was increased by raising the vancomycin concentration. pH 4 allowed the baseline resolution of the five studied analytes in the presence of 2.5 mM of chiral selector and an increase in pH caused a decrease of R(s).",Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,23,17,3035-40,2025-11-04 11:05:35,2025-11-04 11:05:35

It is generally accepted that MMPs are secreted in a latent form (proMMP) and are activated only upon removal of their inhibitory propeptides. This report shows that three members of the SIBLING (Small, Integrin-Binding LIgand, N-linked Glycoprotein) family can specifically bind (Kd approximately equal nM) and activate three different MMPs. Binding of SIBLING to their corresponding proMMPs is associated with structural changes as indicated by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, increased susceptibility to plasmin cleavage, and decreased inhibition by specific natural and synthetic inhibitors. Activation includes both making the proMMPs enzymatically active and the reactivation of the TIMP (tissue inhibitors of MMP) inhibited MMPs. Bone sialoprotein specifically binds proMMP-2 and active MMP-2, while osteopontin binds proMMP-3 and active MMP-3, and dentin matrix protein-1 binds proMMP-9 and active MMP-9. Both pro and active MMP-SIBLING complexes are disrupted by the abundant serum protein, complement Factor H, thereby probably limiting SIBLING-mediated activation to regions immediately adjacent to sites of secretion in vivo.

The gastrointestinal tract is not only the site of food digestion and absorption but also contains a variety of appetite-regulating signals such as gut-brain peptides, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), bacterial proteins, and cellular components produced by gut microbes. While the central nervous system (CNS), as the core of appetite regulation, can receive and integrate these appetite signals and send instructions to downstream effector organs to promote or inhibit the body's feeding behaviour. This review will focus on the gut-brain axis mechanism of feeding behaviour, discussing how the peripheral appetite signal is sensed by the CNS via the gut-brain axis and the role of the central ""first order neural nuclei"" in the process of appetite regulation.

Our laboratory has been interested in characterizing the role thioredoxin (TRX) plays in regulating cellular redox status in airway epithelium. TRX is a small, ubiquitous protein with two redox-active half-cysteine residues, -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, in its active center. Using primary passage-1 human tracheobronchial epithelial cell cultures and an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, HBE1, we observed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha enhanced NF-kappa B transcriptional activity. This observation was based on gel mobility shift assays and interleukin (IL)-8 promoter-reporter gene transfection studies. TNF-alpha activation coincided with translocation of NF-kappa B p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) (1 to 10 mM) or glutathione (1 to 10 mM) inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappa B transcriptional activity and IL-8 promoter-mediated reporter gene expression. In contrast, elevated TRX protein levels in cells enhanced TNF-alpha-dependent NF-kappa B transcriptional activity and IL-8 promoter activity. This observation was independent of the manner in which TRX was elevated in cells (e.g., by cotransfection with a FLAG-TRX expression clone, or by direct exposure to commercially available human TRX protein). Localization of TRX protein by anti-TRX antibody indicated an accumulation of TRX protein in the nucleus after TNF-alpha treatment. The nuclear localization phenomenon was different from the major cytosolic accumulation of glutathione and NAC. This is the first known report demonstrating movement of TRX into the nucleus of airway epithelial cells after an inflammatory stress. These results suggest a compartment effect of thiol chemicals in the regulation of redox-dependent transcriptional activity.",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,25,2,178-85,2025-11-04 11:05:44,2025-11-04 11:05:44

2458630,"J E Vaughn, R P Barber, T J Sims",1988,Dendritic development and preferential growth into synaptogenic fields: a quantitative study of Golgi-impregnated spinal motor neurons.,"Branching patterns of dendrites may be modulated by the way in which dendritic growth cone filopodia come into initial synaptic relationships with afferent axons. This synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching predicts that dendritic growth will be directed preferentially into regions containing numerous prospective presynaptic elements. The developing mouse spinal cord provides a natural experiment to test this prediction, because synapses are found exclusively within the marginal zones bordering the motor columns during the early (E11-14) period of synaptogenesis. During this time, therefore, most motor dendritic growth would be expected to be directed laterally or ventrally into the marginal zones, whereas internally directed growth should become more prevalent later, when synaptogenesis begins to take place within the intermediate zone, i.e., the motor columns proper. A computer-assisted three dimensional reconstruction system has been used to test these expectations in Golgi preparations of developing mouse (C57BL/6J) spinal cords ranging in age from E13 through P1. Mean dendritic lengths and branch densities are significantly greater for marginal zone dendrites than for intermediate zone dendrites at early ages (E13-14), but there are no significant differences in these measures at later stages of development (P0,1). These findings are interpreted as meaning that motor dendritic growth is initially biased into the marginal zone by synaptogenic afferents and that this preferential distribution is progressively lost as synapses develop within the intermediate zone to attract or to stabilize internally directed dendritic growth. Thus the findings of this study are consistent with predictions of the synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching.",Synapse,"Synapse (New York, N.Y.)",2,1,69-78,2025-11-04 11:05:49,2025-11-04 11:05:49

After inhalation of nTiO2, we monitored changes in 5-lipoxygenase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in rat lung tissue. Lung function parameters include specific airway resistance (SRaw), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), functional residual capacity (FRC), and lung compliance (Cchord); blood white blood cell count (WBC), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH); and lung lavage leukotriene C4, interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrotic factor α (TNFα), hydroxyl radicals, and NO. Leukotriene receptor antagonist MK571 and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor MK886 were used for pharmacologic intervention. Compared to control, nTiO2 exposure induced near 5-fold increase in 5-lipoxygenase mRNA expression in lung tissue. iNOS mRNA increased while eNOS mRNA decreased. Lavage leukotriene C4; IL6; TNFα; NO; hydroxyl radicals; and blood WBC, NO, hydrogen peroxide, and LDH levels rose. Obstructive ventilatory insufficiency was observed. MK571 and MK886 both attenuated the systemic inflammation and lung function changes.

The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of paeonol on a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid (MPTP/p)-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). MPTP (25 mg/kg), followed by probenecid (250 mg/kg), was administered via i.p. injection for five consecutive days to induce the mouse model of PD. Paeonol (20 mg/kg) was administrated orally for 21 days. Behavior was assessed using the rotarod performance and open‑field tests. Additionally, the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), microglia, interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β), and brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. MPTP/p‑induced motor deficits were observed to be significantly improved following long‑term treatment with paeonol. Paeonol treatment decreased MPTP/p‑induced oxidative stress, as determined by evaluating the activity levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione. Additionally, MPTP/p‑induced neuroinflammation was assessed by examining the levels of microglia and IL‑1β, which were significantly decreased following paeonol treatment. Paeonol treatment improved the MPTP/p‑induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration, as measured by observing the increased TH level in the SNpc. Furthermore, the BDNF level was significantly elevated in the paeonol treatment group compared with mice treated with MPTP/p only. In conclusion, paeonol exerted therapeutic effects in the MPTP/p‑induced mouse model of PD, possibly by decreasing the damage from oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and by enhancing the neurotrophic effect on dopaminergic neurons. The results demonstrate paeonol as a potential novel treatment for PD.",Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,14,3,2397-404,2025-11-04 11:05:52,2025-11-04 11:05:52

We now report that GnRH induces bleb formation in the gonadotrope-derived LβT2 cells. The blebs appear within ~2 min at a turnover rate of ~2-3 blebs/min and last for at least 90 min. Formation of the blebs requires active ERK1/2 and RhoA-ROCK but not active c-Src. Although the following ligands stimulate ERK1/2 in LβT2 cells: EGF > GnRH > PMA > cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), they produced little or no effect on bleb formation as compared to the robust effect of GnRH (GnRH > PMA > cAMP > EGF), indicating that ERK1/2 is required but not sufficient for bleb formation possibly due to compartmentalization. Members of the above mentioned signalosome are recruited to the blebs, some during bleb formation (GnRHR, c-Src, ERK1/2, focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and tubulin), and some during bleb retraction (vinculin), while F-actin decorates the blebs during retraction. Fluorescence intensity measurements for the above proteins across the cells showed higher intensity in the blebs vs. intracellular area. Moreover, GnRH induces blebs in primary cultures of rat pituitary cells and isolated mouse gonadotropes in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. The novel signalosome-bleb pathway suggests that as with the signalosome, the blebs are apparently involved in cell migration. Hence, we have extended the potential candidates which are involved in the blebs life cycle in general and for the GnRHR in particular.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,8,N/A,113,2025-11-04 11:05:54,2025-11-04 11:05:54

The objective is to retrieve lost data by using the similarity between frames. Usually, error concealment (EC) schemes depend on replacing incorrect data with data that are identical to the initial. This is possible because video contains a high degree of self-similarity. This research focuses on applying an EC approach in transform-domain video sequences. To conduct EC on films, they must first be translated to frames and then transformed using one of the available transformations into frequency-domain images. Using successive frames, it is possible to recover lost or incorrect data from images. Intra-coded frames (I-frames) may be used to recreate lost knowledge in predictive (P-frames) and bidirectional predictive frames (B-frames). I-frame knowledge that has been lost may be restored using previous intra-coded frames. The use of wavelet error concealment generated more precise results than the other techniques.

In normal, these glands have a tubuloalveolar structure. The gland is located in the medio posterior aspect of the orbit. It is lobulated and appears homogeneous in colour and texture. Harderian gland consist of tubules with wide lumina lined by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells surrounded by myoepithelial cells within their basal lamina. It contains porphyrin pigment which is stored as solid intraluminal deposits. The glandular epithelium possesses two cell types, termed A and B. Type A cells are more numerous. The single excretory duct of the gland is directly continuous with endpieces at the hilus and opens nasally and ventrally to the third eyelid. The excretory duct is accompanied by many acini of small serous glands around it. The tubuloalveoli of the gland is not divided into lobules. There is no branched duct system within the gland. The secretion seems to be associated with porphyrins, is essentially released by exocytosis, but holocrine secretion also occurs. The single excretory duct is lined by a stratified epithelium. The gland is surrounded by a collagenous capsule. The adrenalectomy, caused degenerative changes in the glands. Epithelial height was lower than in normal gland epithelium. Most of the acini were completely disorganised. The acinar lumina were filled with porphyrin debris.

Although primarily known for their roles in actin rearrangements and membrane ruffling, translocated effectors also affect host cell processes that are not directly associated with invasion. Here, we show that SopB/SigD, an effector with phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, has anti-apoptotic activity in Salmonella-infected epithelial cells. Salmonella induced the sustained activation of Akt/protein kinase B, a pro-survival kinase, in a SopB-dependent manner. Failure to activate Akt resulted in increased levels of apoptosis after infection with a sopB deletion mutant (DeltasopB). Furthermore, cells infected with wild type bacteria, but not the DeltasopB strain, were protected from camptothecin-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic activity of SopB was dependent on its phosphatase activity, because a catalytically inactive mutant was unable to protect cells from the effects of camptothecin. Finally, small interfering RNA was used to demonstrate the essential role of Akt in SopB-mediated protection against apoptosis. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of apoptosis and highlight how bacterial effectors can intercept signaling pathways to manipulate host responses.",J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,280,10,9058-64,2025-11-04 11:06:18,2025-11-04 11:06:18

However, because ATLL and non-HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms share overlapping clinicopathologic features, the prevalence of ATLL in nonendemic regions is unknown. In this study, 75 T-cell neoplasms randomly procured from the metropolitan New York City area were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of integrated HTLV-I proviral sequences. HTLV-I genomic sequences were detected by PCR in 6 of the 75 cases (8%); this result was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The clinicopathologic features of the HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative T-cell neoplasms were then compared. Although the clinicopathologic features of patients from these two groups overlapped, some findings were more commonly associated with HTLV-I positive neoplasms. Five of the six patients with HTLV-I positive neoplasms were from HTLV-I endemic areas, five were black, five were women, and five were less than 45 years of age, while the majority of the patients with HTLV-I negative T-cell malignancies were elderly white men. The incidence of hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions was significantly more common among patients with HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms (P less than .001 and P = .004, respectively). The immunophenotypes of the HTLV-I positive and negative tumors were similar; however, all HTLV-I positive neoplasms were CD7 negative (P less than .001). In summary, our findings: (1) demonstrate the special clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms, (2) suggest that most of the rare cases of HTLV-I-associated T-cell neoplasms occurring in HTLV-I nonendemic areas are actually endemic cases; and (3) that PCR is a sensitive, clinically useful technique for identifying HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms.",Blood,Blood,77,11,2419-30,2025-11-04 11:06:21,2025-11-04 11:06:21

The effect of host water stress on Septoria canker development was studied in two separate greenhouse experiments. Hybrid poplar clones NM6, NC11396, and NE308 were stressed by withholding water until predawn water potential fell below -1.0 MPa. Stems were treated by removing a leaf and applying agar plugs that were either colonized by S. musiva (inoculated) or sterile (control) to the wound. Cankers on inoculated water-stressed trees were significantly larger than those on nonstressed trees. A leaf disk assay also was conducted three times with the NM6 and NE308 trees. We cut two disks from each of 120 stressed and 120 well-watered trees, placing them on water agar in 24-well tissue culture plates. A conidial suspension was applied to one disk in each pair and sterile water to the other. Inoculated disks from water-stressed trees developed less necrosis than those from well-watered trees.

Based on a replication-deficient chimpanzee Ad vector, AdC7, we generated a novel H5N1 vaccine candidate AdC7-H5HA that expresses H5N1 Hemagglutinin(HA). When tested in mice, the vaccine significantly reduced the virus load and pathological lesions in the lung tissues, and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge by a homologous virus. Mechanistically, the AdC7-H5HA vaccine can induce both HA-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice.

This study was undertaken to relate differences in the relative composition of the three main lipid classes of human stratum corneum, i.e., free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides, to differences in transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum electrical impedance, and corneometer value. A new high performance liquid chromatography/light scattering detection-based analysis method recently developed was used for collection of quantitative lipid data in conjunction with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection measurements on the free fatty acid fraction. After subtraction of contaminating lipid fractions we have estimated the molar ratio of the human skin barrier lipid composition to be, respectively, 15% cholesterol esters, 16% saturated long chain free fatty acids, 32% cholesterol, and 37% ceramides. The inter-individual difference in the relative amount of free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides, respectively, can be >100% in the individual case. It was found that the relative amount of ceramides to cholesterol is larger in the wrist area, paralleled by a higher transepidermal water loss and corneometer value as well as different skin electrical impedance values as compared with the upper forearm area. We conclude that the site-dependent differences in the stratum corneum lipid composition are small compared with the large inter-individual variation.

We have been studying the silicon phthalocyanine Pc 4 for this purpose, a photosensitizer activated with red light. Pc 4 targets the envelope of pathogenic viruses such as HIV. To protect RBC during the process two main approaches are used: (i) inclusion of quenchers of reactive oxygen species produced during the treatment. Tocopherol succinate was found to be most effective for this purpose; (ii) formulation of Pc 4, a lipophilic compound, in liposomes that reduce its binding to RBC but not to viruses. As a light source we used a light emitting diode array emitting at 670-680 nm. An efficient mixing device ensures homogenous light exposure during treatment of intact RBCC. Treatment of 50 ml RBCC with 5 microM Pc 4 and 18 J/cm(2) light results in the inactivation of > or = 5.5 log(10) HIV, > or = 6.3 log(10), VSV and > or = 5 log(10) of PRV and BVDV. The relative sensitivities of these viruses based on the slope of virus kill versus light dose are 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 and 1.9 for HIV, VSV, PRV and BVDV, respectively. To achieve the same level of virus inactivation in 350 ml RBCC, the light dose needed is 40 J/cm(2). HIV actively replicating in CEM cells is as sensitive as cell-free and HIV in latently infected cells is 3-4 times more sensitive. Parasites that can be transmitted by blood transfusion (P. falciparum and T. cruzi) are even more sensitive than viruses. Following treatment, RBCC can be stored for 28 days at 4 degrees C with haemolysis below 1%. Previous studies under less favourable conditions showed that baboon RBC circulated with an acceptable 24 hr recovery and half-life.

These features may be equivocal in the histologic sections. On the other hand, telomerase is expressed in many human cancers and is thought to contribute to their immortality. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the major determinant of human telomerase activity, and its expression is suggestive of capacity for unlimited replication. This case-control study examined the expression of hTERT using immunohistochemistry in 36 thyroid FC and 36 FA from patients who were matched by age and sex. The aim was to investigate the value of immunohistochemical staining for hTERT in the differential diagnosis of follicular neoplasms.

This treatment raised the plasma insulin concentration from 31 +/- 4 to 201 +/- 64 micro-i.u./ml. Hepatocytes prepared from the hyperinsulinaemic animals secreted very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerol (TAG) at a higher rate (172 +/- 21 microgram per 24 h per mg cell protein) than did those from sham-operated controls (109 +/- 12 microgram per 24 h per mg) (P<0.05). However, chronic exogenous hyperinsulinaemia had no stimulatory effect on the secretion of VLDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) in derived hepatocytes compared with those from the sham-operated controls (2.32 +/- 0.38 compared with 3.09 +/- 0.40 microgram per 24 h per mg). Hepatocytes from the hyperinsulinaemic rats thus secreted larger VLDL particles as evidenced by the increased TAG:apoB ratio (78.4 +/- 13.1 compared with 38.4 +/- 7.6; P<0.05). In hepatocytes from the hyperinsulinaemic rats a larger proportion of the newly synthesized TAG was secreted as VLDL. Hepatocytes from the hyperinsulinaemic and the sham-operated control animals were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effect of insulin added in vitro on the secretion of VLDL TAG. Insulin added in vitro to the culture medium of hepatocytes from hyperinsulinaemic animals significantly decreased the TAG:apoB ratio of the secreted VLDL. This change did not occur in hepatocytes from sham-operated rats. These results suggest that, in vivo, chronic hyperinsulinaemia is not in itself sufficient to desensitize the liver to the acute inhibitory effect of insulin on the secretion of VLDL.",Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,314 ( Pt 1),Pt 1,103-8,2025-11-04 11:06:38,2025-11-04 11:06:38

In total, 18- to 40-h old purebred Arabian foals (n = 185) were used. Serum TP concentrations, total solid percentages and IgG concentrations were measured with a digital serum TP refractometer, digital Brix refractometer and the gold standard radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay, respectively. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the refractometer and RID assay results. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to select the optimal cut-offs for both refractometers. Test performance and agreement were evaluated using diagnostic test characteristics at optimal thresholds and areas under the ROC curve, and by calculating Cohen's kappa coefficient. The sensitivity and specificity of the digital Brix refractometer at optimal cut-offs (≤7.8%, ≤7.9%, ≤8.2%, ≤8.3%, ≤9.0%) were 100 and 69.3%; 100% and 68.5%; 70.5% and 71.0%; 88.3% and 85.5%; 88.1% and 76% to estimate RID-IgG of <400 mg/dL, <800 mg/dL, <1500 mg/dL, <2500 mg/dL and < 3000 mg/dL, respectively.

Particularly in MR sequences that encompass multiple RF pulses, e.g., turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences, complete signal loss may occur in certain areas. When using a surface coil for transmitting the RF pulses, these problems become even more challenging, as the spatial B(1) field variance is substantial. As an alternative to conventional TSE sequences, adiabatic TSE sequences can be applied, which have the benefit that these sequences are insensitive to B(1) nonuniformity. In this study, we investigate the potential of using adiabatic TSE at 7 T with surface coil transceivers in human applications. The adiabatic RF pulses were tuned to deal with the constraints in B(1) strength and RF power deposition, but remained in the superadiabatic regime. As a consequence, the dynamic range in B(1) is compromised, and signal modulation is obtained over the echo train. Multidimensional Bloch simulations over the echo train and phantom measurements were obtained to assess these limitations. Still, using proper k-space sampling, we demonstrate improved image quality of the adiabatic TSE versus conventional TSE in the brain, the neck (carotid artery) and in the pelvis (prostate) at 7 T.",Magn Reson Med,Magnetic resonance in medicine,68,2,580-7,2025-11-04 11:06:40,2025-11-04 11:06:40

Differential regulation of the type I TNF receptor during activation of resting and effector T cells.,"The expression of TNF-alpha receptors (TNFR) was examined on a CD4+ T cell hybridoma, transformed T cell lines, CTL clones, and activated T cells from peripheral blood to determine the basis of the immunomodulatory activity of TNF on T cell function. Analyses by ligand cross-linking and competitive binding assays with mAb to the 80-kDa receptor (TNFR-I), demonstrated that the TNFR-I was the predominant receptor expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. However, on T cell leukemic lines, a second, non-TNFR-I binding site was identified, most likely the 55-kDa form (TNFR-II). Additional subsets of T cells were readily distinguished by their expression of TNFR-I and related members of the TNFR gene family (CD40 and CD27). Expression of the TNFR-I was dependent upon the state of T cell activation. Signaling through the TCR for Ag or IL-2R was sufficient to induce TNFR mRNA and protein expression in resting T cells. Multiple sizes of TNFR-I transcripts were detected during T cell activation; however, biosynthetic studies showed these multiple species encode a single protein of 80 kDa. These results, combined with the known ability of TNF to induce IL-2R expression, indicate that TNF and IL-2 form a reciprocating receptor amplification circuit. In contrast, differentiated effector T cells triggered through the TCR or protein kinase C initiated a rapid down-regulation (transmodulation) of the TNFR-I that preceded TNF or lymphotoxin secretion. The mechanism of transmodulation involved proteolytic processing of the mature 80-kDa receptor releasing a soluble 40-kDa fragment. This indicates that a TNF autocrine loop is not likely to form during the response of an effector T cell. Collectively, these results suggest that transcriptional and post-translational modification of the TNFR-I are important control points regulating the expression of this receptor during T cell activation.",J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",147,12,4229-38,2025-11-04 11:06:41,2025-11-04 11:06:41

These include weight loss, reproductive quiescence, and pelage growth with shortening photoperiod and vice versa with lengthening photoperiod. This study reports gene expression changes in the hypothalamus of Siberian hamsters switched from short days (SD) to long days (LD), and also in photorefractory hamsters. Siberian hamsters were maintained in either LD or SD for 14 wk, conditions that generate physiological states of obesity under LD and leanness under SD. After 14 wk, SD lighting was switched to LD and gene expression investigated after 0, 2, 4, and 6 wk by in situ hybridization. Genes encoding nuclear receptors (RXR/RAR), retinoid binding proteins (CRBP1 and CRABP2), and histamine H3 receptor were photoperiodically regulated with significantly lower expression in SD, whereas VGF mRNA expression was significantly higher in SD, in the dorsomedial posterior arcuate nucleus. After a SD-to-LD switch, gene expression changes of CRABP2, RAR, H3R, and VGF occurred relatively rapidly toward LD control levels, ahead of body weight recovery and testicular recrudescence, whereas CRBP1 responded less robustly and rxrgamma did not respond at the mRNA level. In this brain nucleus in photorefractory animals, the CRABP2, RAR, H3R, and VGF mRNA returned toward LD levels, whereas CRBP1 and rxrgamma remained at the reduced SD level. Thus, genes described here are related to photoperiodic programming of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus through expression responses within a subdivision of the arcuate nucleus.",Endocrinology,Endocrinology,146,4,1940-7,2025-11-04 11:06:41,2025-11-04 11:06:41

Diagnostic features on cross sectional echocardiography.,"M mode and cross sectional echocardiography was carried out in three cases of cor triatriatum sinistrum (two infants and one adult). In two cases a peculiar double arch appearance, not previously reported, was found. All three cases were referred for surgery without cardiac catheterisation, and the diagnosis proved to be correct. The characteristic echocardiographic feature of cor triatriatum is an intra-atrial membrane detected in multiple planes of examination, curving anteroinferiorly and inserting some distance away from the mitral valve ring, proximal to the left atrial appendage. Superiorly the membrane runs parallel to, and a short distance behind, the aortic root creating a superior recess of the distal left atrial chamber. These features differentiate cor triatriatum from a supravalvar mitral ring. During diastole the membrane moves forward towards the mitral valve funnel. This, together with the arching appearance of the membrane on four chamber views and the more superior position of the membrane, makes it possible to distinguish cor triatriatum from total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage to the coronary sinus. From a review of past experience at the Brompton Hospital of the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac catheterisation in this condition, it is concluded that cross sectional echocardiography is superior to angiography as a technique for diagnosing cor triatriatum.",Br Heart J,British heart journal,51,2,211-9,2025-11-04 11:06:42,2025-11-04 11:06:42

PPV isolates were introduced into Prunus tomentosa and Nicotiana benthamiana hosts by grafting and mechanical inoculation, respectively. Symptoms were evaluated by following the appearance of circular necrotic spots and mosaic in leaves of P. tomentosa and mosaic and some leaf deformation in N. benthamiana. Molecular analysis was carried out using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, allowing the cloning and sequencing of 1.34-kb fragments corresponding to the 3' region of the replicase gene, the complete coat protein (CP) gene, and the 3' nontranslated region of the PPV genome.

Compared to standard cholate, the use of ultra-pure cholate for solubilization of heart mitochondrial particles significantly increased the fraction of the fast enzyme. Complete homogeneity (approximately 100% fast) was observed when cytochrome c oxidase was solubilized with ultra-pure cholate from heart mitochondrial particles pre-equilibrated with AMP; equilibration with ADP yielded a much smaller fraction of fast enzyme (approximately 35%).

This dangerous disease causes a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage and disrupts brain functioning. The preferred method of AVM treating is embolization, which is the endovascular filling of abnormal AVM vessels with a special embolic agent. Despite the fact that this method is widely used in neurosurgery, in some cases its use is accompanied by perioperative AVM vessels rupture. In this regard, the aim of this work is to study the optimal scenarios for multi-stage AVM embolization from the effectiveness and safety of the procedure point of view. Mathematically, the joint movement of blood and embolic agent in the AVM body is described on the basis of a one-dimensional two-phase filtration model, which takes into account the redistribution of blood to surrounding healthy vessels. For the numerical solution of the resulting integro-differential system of equations, a monotonic modification of the CABARET scheme is used. To find optimal embolization scenarios, the optimal control problem with phase constraints arising from medicine is formulated. A modified particle swarm optimization method is used to solve this problem numerically.

Among them, the calcium channelopathy episodic ataxia type-2 (EA2) is an autosomal dominant disorder related to mutations in the pore-forming Ca(v)2.1 subunit of P/Q-type calcium channels. Although EA2 is linked to loss of Ca(v)2.1 channel activity, the molecular mechanism underlying dominant inheritance remains unclear. Here, we show that EA2 mutants as well as a truncated form (D(I-II)) of the Ca(v)3.2 subunit of T-type calcium channel are misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and subject to proteasomal degradation. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that misfolded mutants bind to nascent wild-type Ca(v) subunits and induce their subsequent degradation, thereby abolishing channel activity. We conclude that this destructive interaction mechanism promoted by Ca(v) mutants is likely to occur in EA2 and in other inherited dominant channelopathies.",J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,28,17,4501-11,2025-11-04 11:06:51,2025-11-04 11:06:51

For example, people frequently walk while looking at their smartphones. Sometimes we walk differently than usual; for example, when walking on ice or snow, we tend to waddle. Understanding walking patterns could provide users with contextual information tailored to the current situation. To formulate this as a machine-learning problem, we defined 18 different everyday walking styles. Noting that walking strategies significantly affect the spatiotemporal features of hand motions, e.g., the speed and intensity of the swinging arm, we propose a smartwatch-based wearable system that can recognize these predefined walking styles. We developed a wearable system, suitable for use with a commercial smartwatch, that can capture hand motions in the form of multivariate timeseries (MTS) signals. Then, we employed a set of machine learning algorithms, including feature-based and recent deep learning algorithms, to learn the MTS data in a supervised fashion. Experimental results demonstrated that, with recent deep learning algorithms, the proposed approach successfully recognized a variety of walking patterns, using the smartwatch measurements. We analyzed the results with recent attention-based recurrent neural networks to understand the relative contributions of the MTS signals in the classification process.",Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",21,19,N/A,2025-11-04 11:06:51,2025-11-04 11:06:51

SCFAs act at two distinct G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), FFAR2 and FFAR3 and are expressed in intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EECs), where they mediate anorectic gut hormone release. EECs also express other GPCRs that act as nutrient sensors, thus SCFAs may elicit some of their health-promoting effects by altering GPCR expression in EECs and enhance gut sensitivity to dietary molecules. Here, we identify that exposure of the murine EEC STC-1 cell line or intestinal organoids to physiological concentrations of SCFAs enhances mRNA levels of the umami taste receptors TASR1 and TASR3, without altering levels of the SCFA GPCRs, FFAR2 and FFAR3. Treatment of EECs with propionate or butyrate, but not acetate, increased levels of umami receptor transcripts, while propionate also reduced CCK expression. This was reversed by inhibiting Gαi/o signaling with pertussis toxin, suggesting that SCFAs act through FFAR2/3 to alter gene expression. Surprisingly, neither a FFAR3 nor a FFAR2 selective ligand could increase TASR1/TASR3 mRNA levels. We assessed the functional impact of increased TASR1/TASR3 expression using unique pharmacological properties of the umami taste receptor; namely, the potentiation of signaling by inosine monophosphate. Activation of umami taste receptor induced inositol-1-phosphate and calcium signaling, and butyrate pretreatment significantly enhanced such signaling. Our study reveals that SCFAs may contribute to EEC adaptation and alter EEC sensitivity to bioactive nutrients.",Front Nutr,Frontiers in nutrition,7,N/A,568991,2025-11-04 11:06:58,2025-11-04 11:06:58

We investigated the role of acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) in the hematogenous metastasis of melanoma cells. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells into wild-type mice resulted in multiple lung metastases, while Asm-deficient mice (Smpd1(-/-) mice) were protected from pulmonary tumor spread. Transplanting wild-type platelets into Asm-deficient mice reinstated tumor metastasis. Likewise, Asm-deficient mice were protected from hematogenous MT/ret melanoma metastasis to the spleen in a mouse model of spontaneous tumor metastasis. Human and mouse melanoma cells triggered activation and release of platelet secretory Asm, in turn leading to ceramide formation, clustering, and activation of α5β1 integrins on melanoma cells finally leading to adhesion of the tumor cells. Clustering of integrins by applying purified Asm or C16 ceramide to B16F10 melanoma cells before intravenous injection restored trapping of tumor cells in the lung in Asm-deficient mice. This effect was revertable by arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptides, which are known inhibitors of integrins, and by antibodies neutralizing β1 integrins.

Here we show that lack of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons causes hypersensitivity to diet-induced obesity due to reduced energy expenditure. The ability of leptin to properly engage the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in POMC neurons and elicit remodeling of perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) is severely compromised in mutant mice. Also, electrophysiological and histomorphomolecular analyses indicate a selective reduction in sympathetic nerve activity and brown-fat-like characteristics in perigonadal WAT of mutant mice, suggesting a physiologically important role for POMC neurons in controlling this visceral fat depot. In summary, our results provide direct genetic evidence that SIRT1 in POMC neurons is required for normal autonomic adaptations against diet-induced obesity.",Cell Metab,Cell metabolism,12,1,78-87,2025-11-04 11:07:02,2025-11-04 11:07:02

Personalized nutrition aims to solve this problem by adapting dietary and lifestyle guidelines to the unique circumstances of each individual. With the latest advances in technology and data science, researchers can now automatically collect and analyze large amounts of data from a variety of sources, including wearable and smart devices. By combining these diverse data, more comprehensive insights of the human body and its diseases can be achieved. However, there are still major challenges to overcome, including the need for more robust data and standardization of methodologies for better subject monitoring and assessment. Here, we present the AI4Food database (AI4FoodDB), which gathers data from a nutritional weight loss intervention monitoring 100 overweight and obese participants during 1 month. Data acquisition involved manual traditional approaches, novel digital methods and the collection of biological samples, obtaining: (i) biological samples at the beginning and the end of the intervention, (ii) anthropometric measurements every 2 weeks, (iii) lifestyle and nutritional questionnaires at two different time points and (iv) continuous digital measurements for 2 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, AI4FoodDB is the first public database that centralizes food images, wearable sensors, validated questionnaires and biological samples from the same intervention. AI4FoodDB thus has immense potential for fostering the advancement of automatic and novel artificial intelligence techniques in the field of personalized care. Moreover, the collected information will yield valuable insights into the relationships between different variables and health outcomes, allowing researchers to generate and test new hypotheses, identify novel biomarkers and digital endpoints, and explore how different lifestyle, biological and digital factors impact health. The aim of this article is to describe the datasets included in AI4FoodDB and to outline the potential that they hold for precision health research.

With the help of magnetic cell sorting and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), osteoblastic subpopulations of mesenchymal progenitor cells were characterized. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) negative cells expressed low levels of osteoblastic and adipocytic markers. AP positive cells expressed adipocytic markers more strongly than the AP negative cell populations, thus suggesting that committed osteoblasts exhibit a greater adipogenic potential. AP negative cells differentiated to the mature osteoblastic phenotype, as demonstrated by increased AP-activity and osteocalcin secretion under standard osteogenic culture conditions. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by increased expression of adipocytic gene markers such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid binding protein. The induction of adipogenic markers was suppressed by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and promoted by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). Osteogenic culture conditions including BMP-2 induced both the formation of mineralized nodules and cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. Upon immunogold electron microscopic analysis, osteoblastic and adipogenic marker proteins were detectable in the same cell. Our results suggest that osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal progenitor cells might not be exclusively reciprocal, but rather, a parallel event until late during osteoblast development.",J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,104,4,1342-55,2025-11-04 11:07:12,2025-11-04 11:07:12

In lungs, they play an important role in the clearance of pathogens and control of inflammation. SP-A and SP-D are also expressed in the female reproductive tract where they play an important role in pregnancy and parturition. However, the role of SP-A and SP-D expressed at the feto-maternal interface (decidua) remains unclear. Here, we have examined the expression of SP-A and SP-D in the murine decidua at 17.5 (pre-parturition) and 19.5dpc (near parturition) and their effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated decidual macrophages. SP-A and SP-D were localized to stromal cells in the murine decidua at 17.5 and 19.5dpc in addition to cells lining the maternal spiral artery. Purified pre-parturition decidual cells were challenged with LPS with and without SP-A or SP-D, and expression of F4/80 and TNF-α were measured by flow cytometry. On their own, SP-A or SP-D did not affect the percentage of F4/80 positive cells while they suppressed the percentage of TNF-α positive cells. However, simultaneous addition of SP-A or SP-D, together with LPS, reduced TNF-α secreting F4/80 positive cells. It is likely that exogenous administration of SP-A and SP-D in decidua can potentially control infection and inflammation mediators during spontaneous term labor and infection-induced preterm labor. Thus, the presence of SP-A and SP-D in the murine decidua is likely to play a protective role against intrauterine infection during pregnancy.",Immunobiology,Immunobiology,221,2,377-86,2025-11-04 11:07:14,2025-11-04 11:07:14

While much is known about the immunological functions of the spleen, the mechanisms governing the development and organization of its stromal microenvironment remain poorly understood. Here we report the generation and analysis of a Tlx1(Cre) (ER) (-Venus) knock-in mouse strain engineered to simultaneously express tamoxifen-inducible CreER(T2) and Venus fluorescent protein under the control of regulatory elements of the Tlx1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor essential for spleen development. We demonstrated that Venus as well as CreER expression recapitulates endogenous Tlx1 transcription within the spleen microenvironment. When Tlx1(Cre) (ER) (-Venus) mice were crossed with the Cre-inducible reporter strain, Tlx1-expressing cells as well as their descendants were specifically labeled following tamoxifen administration. We also showed by cell lineage tracing that asplenia caused by Tlx1 deficiency is attributable to altered contribution of mesenchymal cells in the spleen anlage to the pancreatic mesenchyme. Thus, Tlx1(Cre) (ER) (-Venus) mice represent a new tool for lineage tracing and conditional gene manipulation of spleen mesenchymal cells, essential approaches for understanding the molecular mechanisms of spleen development.",Genesis,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",52,11,916-23,2025-11-04 11:07:15,2025-11-04 11:07:15

Despite the heterogeneous nature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there have been attempts at formulating unified theoretical accounts of the associated impairments in social cognition. A class of prominent theories capitalizes on the link between social interaction and visual perception: effective interaction with others often relies on discrimination of subtle nonverbal cues. It has been proposed that individuals with ASD may rely on poorer perceptual representations of other people's actions as returned by dysfunctional visual circuitry and that this, in turn, may lead to less effective interpretation of those actions for social behavior. It remains unclear whether such perceptual deficits exist in ASD: the evidence currently available is limited to specific aspects of action recognition, and the reported deficits are often attributable to cognitive factors that may not be strictly visual (e.g., attention). We present results from an exhaustive set of measurements spanning the entire action processing hierarchy, from motion detection to action interpretation, designed to factor out effects that are not selectively relevant to this function. Our results demonstrate that the ASD perceptual system returns functionally intact signals for interpreting other people's actions adequately; these signals can be accessed effectively when autistic individuals are prompted and motivated to do so under controlled conditions. However, they may fail to exploit them adequately during real-life social interactions.",J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,35,5,1849-57,2025-11-04 11:07:18,2025-11-04 11:07:18

However, traditional fusion models ignore the correlation between these two modalities, resulting in limited performance improvement. To address this problem, a modality-correlation embedding model was proposed for breast tumor diagnosis by combining mammography and ultrasound imaging. By jointly optimizing the correlation between mammography and ultrasound and classification loss of individual modalities, two mappings are learned to project mammography and ultrasound from their original feature spaces into a common label space. A novel modality-correlation term is introduced to maintain the pairwise closeness of multimodal data in the common label space. Contrary to previous studies that did not consider the correlation between multimodal data, the proposed term can exploit the learned correlation information in the fusion process, which guarantees the consistency of the diagnosis results of multimodal images from the same patient. The proposed method was evaluated on our dataset, which contained ultrasound and mammography images from 73 patients. The area under the ROC curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 95.83, 95, 91.67, 95.83, 95.83, and 88.89%, respectively.

MRE was successfully applied to healthy and pathological muscles. However, the MRE muscle methods must be further improved to characterize the deep muscles. A way will be to develop phantom mimicking the muscle behavior in order to set up new MRE protocol. Thus, the purpose of this study is to create a phantom composed of a similar skeletal muscle architecture (fiber, aponorosis) and equivalent elastic properties as a function of the muscle state (passive or active). Two homogeneous phantoms were manufactured with different concentrations of plastisol to simulate the elastic properties in relaxed (50% of plastisol) and contracted (70% of plastisol) muscle conditions. Moreover, teflon tubing pipes (D = 0.9 mm) were thread in the upper part of the phantom (50%) to represent the muscle fibers and a plastic sheet (8 × 15 cm) was also included in the middle of the phantom to mimic the aponeurosis structure. Subsequently, MRE tests were performed with two different pneumatic drivers, tube and round, (f = 90Hz) to analyze the effect of the type of driver on the wave propagation. Then, the wavelength was measured from the phase images to obtain the elastic properties (shear modulus). Both phantoms revealed elastic properties which were in the same range as in vivo muscle in passive (μ(50%) = 2.40 ± 0.18 kPa ) and active (6.24 ± 0.21 kPa) states. The impact of the type of driver showed higher values (about 1.2kPa) with the tube. The analysis of the wave behavior revealed a sliding along the plastic sheet as it was observed for in vivo muscle study. The wave was also sensitive to the presence of the fibers where gaps were identified. The present study demonstrates the ability of the phantom to mimic the structural and functional properties of the muscle.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

18031107,S Bergan,1997,Optimisation of azathioprine immunosuppression after organ transplantation by pharmacological measurements.,"Azathioprine undergoes extensive metabolism in vivo. Most of its immunosuppressive and myelotoxic effects are exerted by the intracellular metabolites 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). There is large individual variability in thiopurine pharmacokinetics. When transplant recipients are started on the standard azathioprine dosage, low and probably subtherapeutic 6-TGN concentrations [<100 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (RBC)] are measured in the majority of patients with normal kidney function. When renal function is severely impaired, 6-TGN concentrations rise 8- to 10-fold or higher. Due to genetic polymorphism, the activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is intermediate to undetectable in approximately 11% of the population. With low TPMT activity, transmethylation is reduced and more intermediate metabolites are left for alternative pathways such as 6-TGN formation. High 6-TGN concentrations are associated with increased frequency and severity of leucopenia. It has been suggested that active monitoring of azathioprine to keep 6-TGN concentrations between 100 and 200 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC may contribute to more effective treatment by reducing the incidence of rejection episodes and leucopenia.

We hypothesize that focal cerebellar lesions can also have lateralized effects on procedural learning. Our objective was to assess the effects of focal cerebellar lesions in procedural learning as measured by the SRTT. We studied 14 patients with single, unilateral vascular lesions in the territory of the posterior-inferior or superior cerebellar artery, who were compared with ten age- and sex-matched controls in a one-handed version of the SRTT. Patients with lesions at any other level of the brain or posterior fossa were excluded by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Our results show that patients do not acquire procedural knowledge when performing the task with the hand ipsilateral to the lesion, but show normal learning with the contralateral hand. No correlation was found with the side, size, or vascular territory of the lesion. We conclude that procedural learning is impaired in hemispheric cerebellar lesions and involves only the hand ipsilateral to the lesion, which suggests a critical role for the cerebellum and/or crossed cerebellar-prefrontal connections in this type of learning.",Exp Brain Res,Experimental brain research,120,1,25-30,2025-11-04 11:07:27,2025-11-04 11:07:27

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is known to interact with cells of the CNS and its intracerebral inoculation to susceptible mice strains causes neurological disorders resembling multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we reported that primary astrocyte cultures from SJL/J susceptible mice when infected with TMEV released important amounts of nitrites (NO2-) to the culture medium, as measured in the supernatants 24 hours after infection. In addition, we observed an increment in the production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by susceptible SJL/J strain derived astrocytes infected with TMEV. The treatment with the thiolic antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine partially suppressed the virus-stimulated production of nitric oxide and TNF-alpha, in a dose response fashion. These results indicate that during viral infection astrocytes are an important cellular source of nitric oxide and TNF-alpha, substances which play important roles during CNS inflammatory events.

A screening procedure is described that permitted the isolation of four spontaneous mutations at the gamma1 structural gene locus. These originate from four mutation events. Two seem to be point mutations: a ""nonsense"" and a ""mis-sense."" Of the other two, one is a frameshift leading to mistranslation and early termination, the other a large deletion due to perhaps an intrachromosomal translocation or a mitotic recombination. Fusion between myeloma-producing cells has shown that variable and constant region genes cannot be scrambled. Differentiation from stem to plasma cells seems to involve changes in the primary sequence of the DNA. Fusion between myeloma cells and spleen cells from immunized animals is a satisfactory method for the derivation of permanent tissue culture lines producing specific antibody. The hybrids express the myeloma as well as the specific antibody light and heavy chains. By subcloning and selection, one can derive lines that selectively lose individual chains. Lines that no longer express the myeloma components can thus be derived.

Two models that describe tumor growth depending on vascular mass and regulation of new vessel formation through a key angiogenic factor are explored. The first model is formulated in terms of ODEs, while the second assumes delays in this regulation, thus leading to a system of DDEs. In both models, the only nontrivial critical point is always unstable, while one of the trivial critical points is always stable. The models predict unlimited growth, if the initial condition is close enough to the nontrivial critical point, and this growth may be characterized by oscillations in tumor and vascular mass. We suggest that angiogenesis per se does not suffice for explaining the observed stabilization of vascular tumor size.",Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2,3,511-25,2025-11-04 11:07:33,2025-11-04 11:07:33

Notch signaling serves pleiotropic roles in the immune system that also contribute to virus-specific immunity. In this study, we assessed Notch signal-related gene expression after administrating nucleoside or nucleotide analogues to HBV-replicating cells and clinical liver tissues. We found distinct Notch signaling expression patterns under nucleos(t)ide analogues therapies, with high expression for nucleotide analogues (adefovir pivoxil or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and low expression for nucleoside analogues (lamivudine or entecavir) in the presence of HBV infection. Furthermore, activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation was also observed after nucleotide analogue treatment.

A mAb (anti-Ct), recognizing a similar feature near the end of the rod domain of vimentin, desmin, and peripherin (epsilon site or epsilon epitope), was characterized. Anti-idiotypic antibodies, generated by immunizing rabbits with purified anti-Ct, recognize a site (presumably ""complementary"" to the epsilon epitope) common among vimentin, desmin, and peripherin (beta site or beta epitope). The beta epitope is represented in a synthetic peptide (PII) modeled after the 30 COOH-terminal residues of peripherin, as seen by comparative immunoblotting assays. Consistent with the idea of an association between the epsilon and the beta site, PII binds in vitro to intact IF proteins and fragments containing the epsilon epitope, but not to IF proteins that do not react with anti-Ct. Microinjection experiments conducted in vivo and filament reconstitution assays carried out in vitro further demonstrate that ""uncoupling"" of this site-specific association (by competition with PII or anti-Ct) interferes with normal IF architecture, resulting in the formation of filaments and filament bundles with diameters much greater than that of the normal IFs. These thick fibers are very similar to the ones observed previously when a derivative of desmin missing 27 COOH-terminal residues was assembled in vitro (Kaufmann, E., K. Weber, and N. Geisler. 1985. J. Mol. Biol. 185:733-742). As a molecular explanation, we propose here that the epsilon and the beta sites of type III IF proteins are ""complementary"" and associate during filament assembly. As a result of this association, we further postulate the formation of a surface-exposed ""loop"" or ""hairpin"" structure that may sterically prevent inappropriate filament-filament aggregation and regulate filament thickness.",J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,114,4,773-86,2025-11-04 11:07:38,2025-11-04 11:07:38

The aim of this review is to summarize the data linking oxidative events to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Despite abundant data supporting the presence of lipid and protein oxidation in the vascular wall, the poor performance of antioxidant strategies in limiting either atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events from atherosclerosis remain a fundamental problem for implicating oxidative stress as pathophysiologically important. Direct evidence that oxidative stress in general, and the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein in particular, is both necessary and sufficient for atherosclerosis has been difficult to find. There are many potential reasons for this difficulty, not the least of which is our lack of sufficient knowledge delineating the precise molecular events that beget oxidative stress in the vessel wall, and the precise mediators involved. Further investigation elucidating these oxidative events are required to provide us with the tools to limit oxidative stress at its source and ameliorate all of its secondary phenomena.

In an unperfused axon, repetitive stimulation at a frequency of about 100 Hz produced two kinds of optical response. The initial response had a brief, spike-like time course and was elicited by each stimulating pulse. The delayed response had a slow time course and the sign of decreased light intensity, and summated with repetitive stimulation. Most of the axoplasm was removed from interior of the axon by intracellular perfusion with solutions containing pronase at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The delayed response could selectively be eliminated by perfusion with a pronase-containing solution for 2-8 min. The result was interpreted as showing that the delayed birefringence signal originates from axoplasm when its gel structure was transiently disturbed by an increased Ca2+ influx associated with excitation. When perfusion was further continued the duration of the action potential started increasing and often a prominent after-depolarization appeared. At this stage the initial optical response was again followed by a large slow signal with the sign of increased light intensity. This reversed delayed response was tentatively assumed to originate from the membrane with some remaining axoplasm, but its cause is still not understood.",Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,436,4,833-42,2025-11-04 11:07:41,2025-11-04 11:07:41

Mice with UPS impairment in the nigra have been used for investigating mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and for testing pre-clinical drugs to treat PD. However, the pathological, biochemical and behavioral features of UPS impairment animal model of PD have not been fully evaluated. For this purpose, we developed a UPS impairment model of nigral dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration by microinjection with proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, PSI or MG-132 into the medial forebrain bundle (iMFB) of C57BL/6 mice and then systematically examined the animal's locomotor activities, and various pathological and biochemical markers of PD. We found that lactacystin iMFB induced a sustained DA neuron degeneration, which can be reproduced by PSI iMFB and MG-132 iMFB. In the animal model, DA neuron degenerated preferentially in the substantia nigra, accompanied by profound inhibition of proteasomal activity, activation of caspase 3, elevated insoluble ubiquitin conjugates and α-synuclein positive inclusion-like granules, activated glia, and decreased motor activities. Thus, this model recapitulates many neuropathological and behavioral features of PD, rendering it likely suitable for studying the mechanisms of nigral DA neuron degeneration and for testing the potential anti-PD medications.",J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,115,1,188-99,2025-11-04 11:07:43,2025-11-04 11:07:43

To test the hypotheses that blood volume (BV) recovery after haemorrhage in pregnant (P) is faster than in nonpregnant (NP) rabbits, and that this can be explained by a higher capillary filtration, a 20% BV haemorrhage was produced in a group of 7 P and 7 NP rabbits. We determined the BV recovery (measured by 99Tc), the total plasma protein mass and the haematocrit at 10, 20, 30, 60 and 1440 min after haemorrhage. Arterial and venous pressures and heart rate were measured during a 30-min control period, during the 10 min of haemorrhage, and for the following 70 min. In a separate group of P and NP rabbits, 125I-labelled albumin was infused and blood samples were obtained at 10, 20, and 30 min. Capillary filtration was expressed as the percentage of radioactive albumin that left the intravascular space after 30 min. No differences were found in the rate of BV recovery, arterial and venous pressures, or heart rate response between P and NP animals (P > 0.1).

Immature ticks included 186 nymphs and 17 larvae and were primarily I. scapularis and A. americanum. Adult I. scapularis were most reported to be attached to the dorsal head and neck; A. americanum to the abdomen and perianal region; and D. variabilis to the back and ear.

Confocal microscopy after labelling with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate showed H2O2 to be located largely in the secondary cell walls in developing tracheary elements. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed there were lower levels of H2O2 in the population containing tracheary elements when H2O2 scavengers such as ascorbate, catalase, and reduced glutathione were applied to the cell culture. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase and SOD also reduced the amount of H2O2 in the tracheary elements. Furthermore, addition of these compounds to cell cultures at the time of tracheary element initiation reduced the amount of lignin and the development of the secondary cell walls. Analysis of UV excitation under a confocal laser scanning microscope confirmed these results. The expression of hipI-SOD increased as the number of tracheary elements in the cell culture increased and developed. Additionally, immunolocalization of a hipI-SOD isoform during the tracheary element differentiation showed a developmental build-up of the protein in the Golgi apparatus and the secondary cell wall.

However, by scrutinizing heat-stressed populations of the model bacterium Escherichia coli, we uncovered the existence of a deterministic asymmetry in cell division that is caused by the presence of intracellular protein aggregates (PAs). While these structures typically locate at the cell pole and segregate asymmetrically among daughter cells, we now show that the presence of a polar PA consistently causes a more distal off-center positioning of the FtsZ division septum. The resulting increased length of PA-inheriting siblings persists over multiple generations and could be observed in both E. coli and Bacillus subtilis populations.

The arginated form of ASP, i.e. complement C3a (C3a), stimulates immunological responses in human granulocytes, mast cells, guinea pig platelets and guinea pig macrophages; however, ASP is inactive in stimulating these responses. Thus both ASP and C3a are bioactive across species but are not functionally interchangeable. Tertiary structure of both proteins by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy predicts a tightly linked core region consisting of three alpha-helices linked via three disulphide bonds, with one of the alpha-helices extending out from the core and terminating in a flexible conformationally irregular carboxy-tail region. The present studies were undertaken in order to define the functionally active domains of ASP, distinctive from those of C3a, using chemical modifications, enzymic cleavage and synthetic peptide fragments. The results indicate that: (i) the N-terminal region (<10 amino acids) plays little role in ASP receptor binding and triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation; (ii) the native C-terminal region had no activity, but modifications which increased hydrophobicity increased receptor binding, and led to some activation of triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation; (iii) an intact disulphide-linked core region is essential for triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation activity but not for receptor interaction. Finally, basic charges in the carboxy region (His) are essential for ASP triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation but not for receptor binding, whereas both functions are eliminated by the modification of Lys in the disulphide-linked core region. The present results suggest that there are two functional domains in ASP, one that is responsible for the initial binding to the cell surface receptor, and a second domain that activates and increases triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation. This contrasts markedly with the structure-function studies of C3a where both binding competency and function were dependent on the C-terminal Arg. Thus ASP demonstrates distinct bioactivity.",Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,342 ( Pt 1),Pt 1,41-8,2025-11-04 11:07:52,2025-11-04 11:07:52

Here, in this work, a novel microfluidic chip based on co-flow step emulsification is proposed for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which can achieve droplet generation, droplet array self-assembly, PCR amplification, and fluorescence detection on a single device. With the combination of single-layer lithography and punching operation, a step microstructure was constructed and it served as the key element to develop a Laplace pressure gradient at the Rayleigh-Plateau instability interface so as to achieve droplet generation. It is demonstrated that the fabrication of step microstructure is low cost, easy-to-operate, and reliable. In addition, the single droplet volume can be adjusted flexibly due to the co-flow design; thus, the ddPCR chip can get an ultrahigh upper limit of quantification to deal with DNA templates with high concentrations. Furthermore, the volume fraction of the resulting droplets in this ddPCR chip can be up to 72% and it results in closely spaced droplet arrays, makes the best of CCD camera for fluorescence detections, and is beneficial for the minimization of a ddPCR system. The quantitative capability of the ddPCR chip was evaluated by measuring template DNA at concentrations from 20 to 50 000 copies/μL. Owing to the characteristics of low cost, easy operation, excellent quantitative capability, and minimization, the proposed ddPCR chip meets the requirements of DNA molecule quantification and is expected to be applied in the point-of-care testing field.",Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,94,9,3939-3947,2025-11-04 11:07:53,2025-11-04 11:07:53

Due to the particularity of the interlinks between networks, the synchronization in interdependent networks has received increasing interest. Since the interlinks are not always symmetric in interdependent networks, we focus on the synchronization in unidirectional interdependent networks to study the control scheme. The mathematical model is put forward and some factors are taken into consideration, such as different coupling functions and strengths. Firstly, the feasibility of the control scheme is proved theoretically by using Lyapunov stability theory and verified by simulations. Then, we find that the synchronization could be maintained in one sub-network by utilizing our control scheme while the nodes in the other sub-network are in chaos. The result indicates that the influence of interlinks can be decreased and the proposed scheme can guarantee the synchronization in one sub-network at least. Moreover, we also discuss the robust of our control scheme against the cascading failure. The scheme is verified by simulations to be effective while the disturbances occur.",PLoS One,PloS one,17,5,e0267909,2025-11-04 11:07:54,2025-11-04 11:07:54

The determination of the morphology of the joint is an important part of the diagnosis as well as the monitoring of the treatment results. It can be accomplished by measurement of the TMJ gap width at three selected places, taken at a specific cross-section. This study presents a new approach to these measurements. First, the CBCT images are denoised using curvilinear methods, and the volume of interest is determined. Then, the orientation of the vertical cross-section plane is computed based on segmented axial sections of the TMJ head. Finally, the cross-section plane is used to determine the standardized locations, at which the width of the gap between condyle and fossa is measured.

These data provide important information about the causal dependency among a set of random variables. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm to learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) based on MTS data, focusing on learning the local structure of a given target variable. Our algorithm is based on learning all parents (P), all children (C) and some descendants (D) (PCD) iteratively, utilizing the time order of the variables to orient the edges. This time series PCD-PCD algorithm (tsPCD-PCD) extends the previous PCD-PCD algorithm to dependent observations and utilizes composite likelihood ratio tests (CLRTs) for testing the conditional independence. We present the asymptotic distribution of the CLRT statistic and show that the tsPCD-PCD is guaranteed to recover the true DAG structure when the faithfulness condition holds and the tests correctly reject the null hypotheses. Simulation studies show that the CLRTs are valid and perform well even when the sample sizes are small. In addition, the tsPCD-PCD algorithm outperforms the PCD-PCD algorithm in recovering the local graph structures.

Epistatic interactions are common in complex phenotypes and depend on genetic backgrounds. To dissect genetic architecture of atherosclerosis, we analyzed F2 progeny from a cross between apolipoprotein E-null mice on DBA/2J (DBA-apoE) and C57BL/6J (B6-apoE) genetic backgrounds and compared the results with those from two previous F2 crosses of apolipoprotein E-null mice on 129S6/SvEvTac (129-apoE) and DBA-apoE backgrounds, and B6-apoE and 129-apoE backgrounds. In these round-robin crosses, in which each parental strain was crossed with two others, large-effect QTLs are expected to be detectable at least in two crosses. On the other hand, observation of QTLs in one cross only may indicate epistasis and/or absence of statistical power.

However, multiple loci, including Aath1 (Chr1:49 cM), and Aath2 (Chr1:70 cM) follow the second type of pattern, showing significant peaks in only one of the three crosses (B6-apoE x 129-apoE). As for atherosclerosis at aortic root, the majority of QTLs, including Ath29 (Chr9:33 cM), Ath44 (Chr1:68 cM) and Ath45 (Chr2:83 cM), was also inconsistent, being significant in only one of the three crosses.

This information is then used to provide generalized recommendations for researchers to consider as they attempt to study plastics in analytically complex environments; including method validation using reference particles obtained via the presented creation methods, encouraging efforts towards method standardization through the reporting of all technical details utilized in a study, and providing analytical pathway recommendations depending upon the exact knowledge desired and samples being studied.",Chemosphere,Chemosphere,293,N/A,133514,2025-11-04 11:08:07,2025-11-04 11:08:07

However, data is quite limited regarding its action and mechanism, especially in hematologic cancer types. Here, antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of whole extract of the rhizome of Zingiber officinalis (ZOWE), was investigated in K562 cell line derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient. Various concentrations of whole extract (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM) were tested in K562 cultures. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis was assessed with appropriate methods, as well as cellular ROS levels. In this study, we showed that ZOWE inhibited proliferation of K562 cells substantially, when compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donor. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased PARP cleavage demonstrated that ZOWE inhibited proliferation by induction of apoptosis. These changes were coupled with an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, ZOWE addition to the culture also reduced expression levels of survival proteins pAkt and survivin, in a concentration dependent manner. Our results clearly mark that ZOWE causes to a reduction in cell viability, an induction of apoptosis and elevation in ROS levels in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and effects are significantly different from healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells, further supporting its potential therapeutic value.",Gene,Gene,692,N/A,217-222,2025-11-04 11:08:08,2025-11-04 11:08:08

Despite its importance, the regulation of AQP4 expression involved in transmembrane water movements still remains rudimentary. Many studies suggest that the internalization of several membrane-bound proteins, including AQP4, may occur with or without lysosomal degradation. Previously, we investigated the internalization of AQP4 in retinal ischemic-reperfusion model. Here, we test the hypothesis that AQP4 is internalized post-ICH and then degraded in the lysosome. The results demonstrated that both AQP4 and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) co-localized in perihematomal region at 6 hr post-ICH. In addition, AQP4 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) also co-localized in perihematomal region, with co-expression increasing followed by a gradual decrease at different time windows post-ICH (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr). After ICH, the Evans blue leakage happened very early at 1 hr and the brain swelling occurred at 3 hr. Moreover, we also found the AQP4 mRNA and AQP4 protein were increased post-ICH. These results suggest that AQP4 is internalized and the lysosome is involved in degrading the internalized AQP4 post-ICH.

In situ hybridization histochemistry was used, with oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. The distribution of cholinergic cells was examined in consecutive sections with probes complementary to choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Furthermore, the microscopic distribution of muscarinic cholinergic binding sites was examined with a non-selective ligand ([3H]N-methylscopolamine) and with ligands proposed to be M1-selective ([3H]pirenzepine) or M2-selective ([3H]oxotremorine-M). The majority of choline acetyltransferase mRNA-rich (i.e. cholinergic) cell groups (medial septum-diagonal band complex, nucleus basalis, pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, nucleus parabigeminalis, several motor nuclei of the brainstem, motoneurons of the spinal cord), also contained m2 mRNA, strongly suggesting that at least a fraction of these receptors may be presynaptic autoreceptors. A few groups of cholinergic cells were an exception to this fact: the medial habenula and some cranial nerve nuclei (principal oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus). Furthermore, m2 mRNA was not restricted to cholinergic cells but was also present in many other cells throughout the rat brain. The distribution of m2 mRNA was in good, although not complete, agreement with that of binding sites for the M2 preferential agonist [3H]oxotremorine-M, but not with [3H]pirenzepine binding sites. Regions where the presence of [3H]oxotremorine-M binding sites was not correlated with that of m2 mRNA are the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and islands of Calleja. The present results strongly suggest that the M2 receptor is expressed by a majority of cholinergic cells, where it probably plays a role as autoreceptor. However, many non-cholinergic neurons also express this receptor, which would be, presumably, postsynaptically located. Finally, comparison between the distribution of m2 mRNA and that of the proposed M2-selective ligand [3H]oxotremorine-M indicates that this ligand, in addition to M2 receptors, may also recognize in certain brain areas other muscarinic receptor populations, particularly M4.",Neuroscience,Neuroscience,47,2,367-93,2025-11-04 11:08:11,2025-11-04 11:08:11

We have earlier observed prominent mannose-binding lectin (MBL) acute phase responses in experimentally ER infected chickens. The present study aimed to further examine immune responses to ER by using chickens selectively bred for high (L10H) and low (L10L) serum MBL levels. Chickens were infected with ER at 3 weeks of age and immune parameters and bacterial load were monitored in blood until day 18 after infection. Blood and spleen leukocytes collected on day 18 were stimulated in vitro with ER antigens and blast transformation of different T-cell populations was assessed. The ER infection gave a very varied outcome and no clear differences were observed between L10H and L10L chickens with respect to leukocyte counts, bacterial load or clinical outcome. Nonetheless, rapid innate responses, e.g., heterophilia and increased serum MBL levels were noted in bacteraemic chickens. All ER infected chickens also showed transient increased expression of mannose receptor MRC1L-B and decreased expression of major histocompatibility complex II on monocytes day 1 after infection indicating monocyte activation or relocation. In vitro ER stimulation showed antigen specific blast transformation of CD4+, TCRγ/δ-CD8αβ+ and TCRγ/δ+CD8αβ+ spleen cells from all infected chickens. For CD4+ and TCRγ/δ-CD8αβ+ cells the proportions of blast transformed cells were significantly higher for samples from L10L chickens than those for samples from L10H chickens.

12269861,Wolfgang Löscher,2002,Basic pharmacology of valproate: a review after 35 years of clinical use for the treatment of epilepsy.,"Since its first marketing as an antiepileptic drug (AED) 35 years ago in France, valproate has become established worldwide as one of the most widely used AEDs in the treatment of both generalised and partial seizures in adults and children. The broad spectrum of antiepileptic efficacy of valproate is reflected in preclinical in vivo and in vitro models, including a variety of animal models of seizures or epilepsy. There is no single mechanism of action of valproate that can completely account for the numerous effects of the drug on neuronal tissue and its broad clinical activity in epilepsy and other brain diseases. In view of the diverse molecular and cellular events that underlie different seizure types, the combination of several neurochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms in a single drug molecule might explain the broad antiepileptic efficacy of valproate. Furthermore, by acting on diverse regional targets thought to be involved in the generation and propagation of seizures, valproate may antagonise epileptic activity at several steps of its organisation. There is now ample experimental evidence that valproate increases turnover of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and thereby potentiates GABAergic functions in some specific brain regions thought to be involved in the control of seizure generation and propagation. Furthermore, the effect of valproate on neuronal excitation mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors might be important for its anticonvulsant effects. Acting to alter the balance of inhibition and excitation through multiple mechanisms is clearly an advantage for valproate and probably contributes to its broad spectrum of clinical effects. Although the GABAergic potentiation and glutamate/NMDA inhibition could be a likely explanation for the anticonvulsant action on focal and generalised convulsive seizures, they do not explain the effect of valproate on nonconvulsive seizures, such as absences. In this respect, the reduction of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) release reported for valproate could be of interest, because GHB has been suggested to play a critical role in the modulation of absence seizures. Although it is often proposed that blockade of voltage-dependent sodium currents is an important mechanism of antiepileptic action of valproate, the exact role played by this mechanism of action at therapeutically relevant concentrations in the mammalian brain is not clearly elucidated. By the experimental observations summarised in this review, most clinical effects of valproate can be explained, although much remains to be learned at a number of different levels about the mechanisms of action of valproate. In view of the advances in molecular neurobiology and neuroscience, future studies will undoubtedly further our understanding of the mechanisms of action of valproate.",CNS Drugs,CNS drugs,16,10,669-94,2025-11-04 11:08:20,2025-11-04 11:08:20

The aim of this study is to verify whether well-being related to different aspects of school life can be explained by a general SWB factor in school. A sample of 1,704 third-grade students (M age = 8.89; SD = 0.4; 48.4% girls) was asked to complete a survey consisting of Likert-type scales.

This selective amplification of the HLA-DRB1*08/12 subset of alleles provides a refinement in HLA oligotyping that permits unambiguous oligotyping of many heterozygotes that cannot be resolved using less selective amplification alternatives.

Herein, Hepatozoon bashtari n. sp., originally infecting the painted saw-scaled viper, Echis coloratus, in Saudi Arabia is described using both morphological features and molecular data from 18S rDNA sequences. The overall prevalence of infection was 60% (9/15) with parasitaemia ranging from 52 to 60%. Gamonts were entirely intraerythrocytic and were observed to cause considerable hypertrophy within the host cell. The mean size of mature gamonts was 15.4 × 3.3 μm. Merogonic stages were confined to the lung endothelial cells with monomorphic meronts. The average size of mature meronts was 32 × 12 μm and they were estimated to produce 13-16 merozoites each. The phylogenetic tree generated from SSU rDNA sequences revealed that Hepatozoon bashtari sp. n. clusters with the vast majority of other Hepatozoon species infecting snakes, lizards and geckos in various regions of the world, which would appear to support the hypothesis of prey-predator transmission of the genus Hepatozoon.

9152959,"G Faury, A Chabaud, M T Ristori, L Robert, J Verdetti",1997,Effect of age on the vasodilatory action of elastin peptides.,"We have recently shown, on young adult rat aorta rings, that elastin peptides induce a dose and endothelium-dependent vasodilation mediated by the 67 kDa subunit of the high affinity elastin-laminin receptor and, at least in part, by EDRF (NO). Here we have studied the effects of elastin peptides at circulating concentrations and below, on noradrenaline-contracted rat aortic rings, as a function of age. First, we have observed that, unlike 2-month-old (2M), 4-6-month-old (4M) and 12-month-old (12M) rat aorta rings, 30-month-old (30M) rat aorta rings were unable to maintain their contraction in long lasting experiments. Secondly, elastin peptides at physiological circulating concentrations (10(-6)-10(-3) mg/ml) induce a dose-dependent vasodilation on 4M rings. By contrast, only higher elastin peptide concentrations (10(-3) mg/ml) were effective on 12M rings, whereas rings from both younger (2M) and older animals (30M) did not respond to elastin peptides. Finally, using lactose and laminin as inhibitors, we have demonstrated that elastin peptide-induced vasodilation on 4M and 12M rings is mediated by the 67 kDa subunit of the elastin-laminin receptor. These experiments suggest that the functional availability of the 67 kDa subunit of the elastin-laminin receptor changes with age. It could be hypothesized that in young animals (0-2M) the reusable shuttle role recently demonstrated for the 67 kDa receptor subunit during elastic fiber formation leads to a major decrease in its availability for signal transduction. On the contrary, in adult animals. (4-12M), when developmental elastogenesis is completed, this subunit is essential for extracellular signal transduction. Inefficiency of this receptor in old animals (30M) can be attributed to its uncoupling from its transduction pathway, as previously shown on human cells. Finally, the age-dependent variations of circulating elastin peptide concentration and elastin-laminin receptor responsiveness to elastin peptides are two independent parameters which could influence the vascular tension regulation.",Mech Ageing Dev,Mechanisms of ageing and development,95,1-2,31-42,2025-11-04 11:08:34,2025-11-04 11:08:34

The deficiency of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1) in CH12F3-2A B cells reduces CSR to ∼20% of wild-type cells, whereas the effect of APE1 loss on SHM has not been examined. Here we show that, although APE1's endonuclease activity is important for CSR, it is dispensable for SHM as well as IgH/c-myc translocation. Importantly, APE1 deficiency did not show any defect in AID-induced S-region break formation, but blocked both the recruitment of repair protein Ku80 to the S region and the synapse formation between Sμ and Sα. Knockdown of end-processing factors such as meiotic recombination 11 homolog (MRE11) and carboxy-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-interacting protein (CtIP) further reduced the remaining CSR in Ape1-null CH12F3-2A cells. Together, our results show that APE1 is dispensable for SHM and AID-induced DNA breaks and may function as a DNA end-processing enzyme to facilitate the joining of broken ends during CSR.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,111,48,17242-7,2025-11-04 11:08:37,2025-11-04 11:08:37

In an attempt to delineate the cellular mechanisms by which unconjugated bilirubin exerts its toxic effects on neuronal cells in the developing brain, bilirubin (0.25-5 microM) was added to the extracellular medium of 6-day-old primary cultured neurons from the embryonic rat forebrain, and cell alterations were studied over the ensuing 96 h. Bilirubin decreased cell viability dose dependently with an ED(50) around 1 microM. At the dose of 0.5 microM, it triggered delayed cell death that affected 24% of the neurons. Nuclear incorporation of the fluorescent dye DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) depicted the presence of apoptosis (16%). Apoptosis features were confirmed by DNA fragmentation reflected by a progressive loss of [(3)H]thymidine and sequential changes in macromolecular synthesis, as shown by the time course of [(3)H]leucine incorporation, as well as by the beneficial effects of cycloheximide and caspase inhibitors. In parallel, treatments with glutamate receptor antagonists showed that MK-801, but not NBQX, protected neurons against bilirubin neurotoxicity, suggesting a role for NMDA receptors in bilirubin effects.

To control the NO3--N contamination in these watersheds, it is necessary to investigate the factors that are related to the export of NO3--N that is only produced by the watershed itself. This study was conducted in the Shibetsu watershed located in eastern Hokkaido, Japan, which gains external groundwater contribution (EXT) and 34% of the annual NO3--N loading occurs through EXT. The riverine NO3--N exports from 1980 to 2009 were simulated by the SWAT model, and the factors controlling the temporal and spatial patterns of NO3--N exports were investigated without considering the EXT. The results show that hydrological events control NO3--N export at the seasonal scale, while the hydrological and biogeochemical processes are likely to control NO3--N export at the annual scale. There was an integrated effect among the land use, topography, and soil type related to denitrification process, that regulated the spatial patterns of NO3--N export. The spatial distribution of NO3--N export from hydrologic response units (HRUs) identified the agricultural areas with surplus N that are vulnerable to nitrate contamination. A new standard for the N fertilizer application rate including manure application should be given to control riverine NO3--N export. This study demonstrates that applying the SWAT model is an appropriate method to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of NO3--N export from the watershed which includes EXT and to identify the crucial pollution areas within a watershed in which the management practices can be improved to more effectively control NO3--N export to water bodies.",Environ Monit Assess,Environmental monitoring and assessment,187,4,206,2025-11-04 11:08:43,2025-11-04 11:08:43

Quite striking among Cuban American men was the high smoking rate among 20-34 year olds (50.1 percent), the highest smoking rate in the three Hispanic groups compared. The age-adjusted smoking rates for Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Cuban American women were much lower than those for men-23.8, 30.3, and 24.4 percent, respectively. Both Puerto Rican and Cuban American men were more likely to be heavy smokers (52.3 and 64.1 percent, respectively, smoking a pack or more a day) as compared to the Mexican Americans (33.8 percent smoking a pack or more a day). The pattern was the same for women, with Mexican American women being lighter smokers (18.8 percent smoking a pack or more a day) as compared to heavy smoking among Puerto Rican and Cuban American women (35.1 and 48.6 percent, respectively, smoking a pack or more a day).

35380962,"Hao Chen, Yangzhun Zhou, Jun Li, Xiu-Shen Wei, Liang Xiao",2022,Self-Supervised Multi-Category Counting Networks for Automatic Check-Out.,"The practical task of Automatic Check-Out (ACO) is to accurately predict the presence and count of each product in an arbitrary product combination. Beyond the large-scale and the fine-grained nature of product categories as its main challenges, products are always continuously updated in realistic check-out scenarios, which is also required to be solved in an ACO system. Previous work in this research line almost depends on the supervisions of labor-intensive bounding boxes of products by performing a detection paradigm. While, in this paper, we propose a Self-Supervised Multi-Category Counting (S2MC2) network to leverage the point-level supervisions of products in check-out images to both lower the labeling cost and be able to return ACO predictions in a class incremental setting. Specifically, as a backbone, our S2MC2 is built upon a counting module in a class-agnostic counting fashion. Also, it consists of several crucial components including an attention module for capturing fine-grained patterns and a domain adaptation module for reducing the domain gap between single product images as training and check-out images as test. Furthermore, a self-supervised approach is utilized in S2MC2 to initialize the parameters of its backbone for better performance. By conducting comprehensive experiments on the large-scale automatic check-out dataset RPC, we demonstrate that our proposed S2MC2 achieves superior accuracy in both traditional and incremental settings of ACO tasks over the competing baselines.",IEEE Trans Image Process,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,31,N/A,3004-3016,2025-11-04 11:08:44,2025-11-04 11:08:44

Comparison of the structures reveals a division of the polymerase into four mobile modules, including a clamp, shown previously to swing over the active center. In the 2.8 angstrom structure, the clamp is in an open state, allowing entry of straight promoter DNA for the initiation of transcription. Three loops extending from the clamp may play roles in RNA unwinding and DNA rewinding during transcription. A 2.8 angstrom difference Fourier map reveals two metal ions at the active site, one persistently bound and the other possibly exchangeable during RNA synthesis.

The large surface area of these biosensors has been commonly recognized as one of the main advantages of the PSi nanostructure. However, in practice, without application of signal amplification strategies, PSi-based biosensors suffer from limited sensitivity, compared to planar counterparts. Using a theoretical model, which describes the complex mass transport phenomena and reaction kinetics in these porous nanomaterials, we reveal that the interrelated effect of bulk and hindered diffusion is the main limiting factor of PSi-based biosensors. Thus, without significantly accelerating the mass transport to and within the nanostructure, the target capture performance of these biosensors would be comparable, regardless of the nature of the capture probe-target pair. We use our model to investigate the effect of various structural and biosensor characteristics on the capture performance of such biosensors and suggest rules of thumb for their optimization.",ACS Sens,ACS sensors,5,10,3058-3069,2025-11-04 11:08:46,2025-11-04 11:08:46

However, little is known about the role of nuclear factor (NF)-κB in these processes. The present study examines whether activation (phosphorylation) of NF-κB by indoxyl sulfate promotes senescence and dysfunction in human proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells). Indoxyl sulfate induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 on Ser-276, which was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant. Furthermore, indoxyl sulfate induced NF-κB p65 expression. Inhibitors of NF-κB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and isohelenin) and NF-κB p65 small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed indoxyl sulfate-induced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and expression of p53, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and α-smoothe muscle actin (SMA). The induction of p53 expression and p53 promoter activity by indoxyl sulfate were inhibited by pifithrin-α, p-nitro, an inhibitor of p53, whereas p53-transfected cells showed enhanced p53 promoter activity. NF-κB inhibitors suppressed indoxyl sulfate-induced p21 expression, whereas NF-κB p65 siRNA enhanced its expression. NF-κB inhibitors partially alleviated indoxyl sulfate-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation. NF-κB p65 siRNA-transfected cells showed less proliferation in the presence of indoxyl sulfate than control cells. Phosphorylated NF-κB p65 was expressed and colocalized with p53, p21, β-galactosidase, TGF-β1, and α-SMA in the kidneys of chronic renal failure (CRF) rats. AST-120, which reduces serum indoxyl sulfate level, suppressed their expression in the CRF rat kidneys. Taken together, NF-κB plays an important role in indoxyl sulfate-induced cellular senescence, fibrotic gene expression, and inhibition of proliferation in proximal tubular cells. More notably, indoxyl sulfate accelerates proximal tubular cell senescence with progression of CRF through reactive oxygen species-NF-κB-p53 pathway.",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Signs of staleness are among others susceptibility to infection and disturbances in well-being. Beside tryptophane and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) glutamine is the most discussed amino acid (AA) in this context. Based on the hypothesis of a multifactorial genesis of staleness and these AA being the metabolic link in psychoimmunology, seven young swimmers of regional top level were examined in a longitudinal field monitoring for biochemical, biomechanical and psycho-physiological data at six different training phases across one year. Special interest was spent on phases with the highest training loads (HT I and II) because of the increased risk of appearance of staleness compared with the regeneration phase (RP). The results point out that well controlled and regulated HT does not reduce but increases the plasma levels of glutamate (means and SD; RP 20 +/- 8 micromol/l, HT I 34 +/- 11 micromol/l), glutamine (RP 489 +/- 155 micromol/l, HT I 634 +/- 113 micromol/l) and BCAA (valine RP 164 +/- 54 micro mol/l, HT I 283 +/- 58 micromol/l, isoleucine RP 59 +/- 20 micromol/l, HT I 101 +/- 24 micromol/l, leucine RP 88 +/- 32 micromol/l, HT I 142 +/- 35 micro mol/l).

The control group comprised 10 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. The free fractions were separated at 37 degrees C using a pressure ultrafiltration method. The highest free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam in uremic patients were 4 to 5-fold the normal. The free fractions were about twice the normal at a creatinine concentration of 800 mumol/l, and 2 to 4-fold at an urea concentration of 20-40 mmol/l. The creatinine and urea correlated with the free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam in a similar manner. The effect of a decreased serum albumin on the free fractions of these drugs was clear when its concentration was under 30 g/l. The creatinine and urea did not correlate with the free fraction of propranolol. However, after mathematically correcting the free fraction of propranolol to correspond to an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) concentration of 0.9 g/l, it correlated significantly with creatinine and urea. The concentration of alpha 1-AGP was the most important determinant for the free fraction of propranolol.

Observations were made of temporal bones sectioned along a plane including the cochlea, the JF, and long axis of the internal auditory canal. The position of the upper margin of the JF was classified according to its relation to the tympanic cavity, the cochlea, and the internal auditory canal. The height of the upper margin of the JF was classified as follows. Low type; inferior to the level of the external auditory canal. Middle type; between the level of the external auditory canal and the cochlea. High type; superior to the level of the cochlea. The results revealed that 58 ears were of low type, 46 middle type, and 16 high type. Middle and high type comprised 62 ears, thus in 52% of ears the upper margin of the JF was situated superior to the external auditory canal. The relation between the JF and the cochlea was classified as follows. Medial type; medial to the medial margin of the cochlea. Lateral type; lateral to the medial margin of the cochlea. The results showed that 74 ears were of medial type, and 46 lateral type. Therefore, in 62% of ears the upper margin of the JF was situated medial to the medial margin of the cochlea. Forty-seven ears of medial type were of middle or high type. Ears of lateral type included none of high type. The jugular bulb diverticulum was observed in 32 ears, which consisted of 3 of low type, 13 middle type, 16 high type. When the upper margin of the JF was positioned higher, the JF was in a more medial position. However, no defect of the bony labyrinth was observed. In conclusion, it is considered that protrusion of the jugular bulb into the tympanic cavity was not caused by the abnormally high position of the JF, but by its lateral displacement. Distances from the JF to the surrounding structures were as follows; to the tympanic membrane 5.58 +/- 2.43mm (mean +/- S.D.), to the tympanic cavity 2.94 +/- 1.92mm, to the cochlea 4.93 +/- 2.20mm, and the internal auditory canal 5.82 +/- 2.38mm.",Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai kaiho,95,6,878-90,2025-11-04 11:08:58,2025-11-04 11:08:58

We studied the release of Cpn60.1 from M. tuberculosis and infected macrophage like cells and compared recombinant Cpn60.1 and Cpn60.2 in a range of cell-based assays to determine how similar the actions of these highly homologous proteins are. We now establish that Cpns are similar as follows: (i) Cpn60.1, as it has been shown for Cpn60.2, is released by M. tuberculosis in culture, and Cpn60.1 is furthermore released when the bacterium is in quiescent, but not activated, macrophage like cells, and (ii) both proteins only showed a partial requirement for MyD88 for the induction of proinflammatory cytokine production compared to lipopolysaccharide. However, we also found major differences in the cellular action of Cpns. (i) Cpn60.2 proved to be a more potent stimulator of whole blood leukocytes than Cpn60.1 and was the only one to induce tumor necrosis factor alpha synthesis. (ii) Cpn60.1 bound to ca. 90% of circulating monocytes compared to Cpn60.2, which bound <50% of these cells. Both chaperonins bound to different cell surface receptors, while monocyte activation by both proteins was completely abrogated in TLR4-/- mice, although Cpn60.2 also showed significant requirement for TLR2. Finally, an isogenic mutant lacking cpn60.1, but containing intact cpn60.2, was severely inhibited in generating multinucleate giant cells in an in vitro human granuloma assay. These results clearly show that, despite significant sequence homology, M. tuberculosis Cpn60 proteins interact in distinct ways with human or murine macrophages.",Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,78,7,3196-206,2025-11-04 11:09:01,2025-11-04 11:09:01

35230149,Mark S Sisterson,2022,Mitigating an Epidemic of Resistance with Integrated Disease Management Tactics: Conflicting Management Recommendations from Insecticide Resistance and Epidemiological Models.,"Insect-transmitted plant pathogens threaten crop production worldwide. Because a single feeding bout may be sufficient for a vector to transmit a pathogen that kills the plant, treatment thresholds for vectors of plant pathogens are low. For many vector species, overreliance on chemical controls has resulted in evolution of insecticide resistance. Analysis of complementary insecticide resistance and epidemiological models indicated that tactics for delaying resistance evolution conflict with tactics for limiting pathogen spread. Insecticide resistance models support maintaining untreated refuges that serve as a source of susceptible insects that reduce the likelihood of mating among rare resistant insects. In contrast, epidemiological models indicate that movement of vectors from untreated areas to insecticide-treated areas contributes to pathogen spread. Accordingly, epidemiological models support area-wide insecticide spray programs, although resistance models indicate that such an approach is likely to lead to rapid resistance. To mitigate risk of insecticide resistance, additional management approaches must be integrated into plant disease management strategies. The resistance and epidemiological models were used to evaluate effects of integrating application of insecticides with two additional management strategies: deployment of partially resistant plants (plants that are not immune to infection but have lower acquisition and inoculation rates than susceptible plants) and mating disruption (reduced vector birth rate in mating disruption-treated areas). Deployment of partially resistant plants reduced the risk that untreated areas served as a source of inoculative vectors. Mating disruption reduced the risk of resistance by suppressing growth of insecticide-resistant populations and benefited disease management by reducing vector abundance. Simulation results indicated that by targeting multiple aspects of the plant-pathogen-vector system, pathogen spread could be suppressed and resistance delayed. Implementation of such an approach will require innovations in vector control and sustained efforts in plant breeding.",Phytopathology,Phytopathology,112,8,1753-1765,2025-11-04 11:09:04,2025-11-04 11:09:04

The actions of insulin and glucocorticoids on amino acid transport and protein degradation are antagonistic in this cell line. In contrast, the actions of these two hormones are additive with regard to the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase. The addition of insulin to HTC cells previously incubated with dexamethasone causes a rapid further doubling in the cellular concentration of this enzyme. The properties of the induction by insulin differ in several respects from the induction by glucocorticoids. The former occurs immediately, without the characteristic lag observed during induction by steroids. Insulin induction of transaminase does not require concomitant RNA synthesis, and does not cause the accumulation of specific mRNA for this enzyme as do glucocorticoids. Using specific immunoprecipitation techniques, we have demonstrated that insulin stimulates a nonselective increase in the rate of total protein synthesis in HTC cells, and a selective decrease in the rate of degradation of tyrosine aminotransferase relative to total protein. Thus the induction of transaminase by insulin involves two distinct actions of the hormone, affecting both synthesis and degradation of protein.",Monogr Endocrinol,Monographs on endocrinology,12,N/A,583-91,2025-11-04 11:09:21,2025-11-04 11:09:21

CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases can specifically target HBV cccDNA for decay, but off-target effects of nucleases in the human genome limit their clinical utility. CRISPR/Cas9 systems from four different species were co-expressed in cell lines with guide RNAs targeting conserved regions of the HBV genome. CRISPR/Cas9 systems from Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) and Streptococcus thermophilus (St) targeting conserved regions of the HBV genome blocked HBV replication and, most importantly, resulted in degradation of over 90% of HBV cccDNA by 6 days post-transfection. Degradation of HBV cccDNA was impaired by inhibition of non-homologous end-joining pathway and resulted in an erroneous repair of HBV cccDNA. HBV cccDNA methylation also affected antiviral activity of CRISPR/Cas9.

Almost all therapy procedures depend on this measure and the wrong WL determination may produce severe consequences, like post-therapeutic pain and the need of a new root canal treatment. Electronic foramen locators (EFL) have been replacing the traditional radiographic imaging as they are faster, easier to use and have a higher success rate when measuring WL. EFLs are based on the root canal impedance assessment between two electrodes: one fixed on the endodontic file that is inserted into the root canal, and the other positioned at oral mucosa membrane. There are only few reported studies that qualify or quantify the root canal impedance characteristics. The present work aims to determine the module of tooth root canal frequency response. The preliminary results show the frequency response module variation as a function of endodontic file position inside the root canal and reinforce the methods based on relative impedance over frequency analysis used in modern EFLs.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

By means of extensive numerical simulations of models in the KPZ universality class we find that, as the noise correlator index increases above some threshold value, the surface exhibits anomalous kinetic roughening of the type described by the generic scaling theory of Ramasco et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2199 (2000)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.84.2199]. Remarkably, as the driving noise temporal correlations increase, the surface develops a characteristic pattern of macroscopic facets that completely dominates the dynamics in the long time limit. We argue that standard scaling fails to capture the behavior of KPZ subject to long-range temporally correlated noise.

The approach produces a form of tissue class priors that can be used to initialize and regularize image segmentation. The signature-based approach is a departure from current location-based methods, which derive tissue class likelihoods based on a voxel's location in standard template space. To use location-based priors, one needs to register the volume in question to the template space, and estimate the image intensity bias field. Two optimizations, over more than a thousand parameters, are needed when high order nonlinear registration is employed. In contrast, the signature-based approach is independent of volume orientation, voxel position, and largely insensitive to bias fields. For these reasons, the approach does not require the use of population derived templates. The prior information is generated from variations in image texture statistics as a function of spatial scale, and an SVM approach is used to associate signatures with tissue types. With the signature-based approach, optimization is needed only during the training phase for the parameter estimation stages of the SVM hyperplanes, and associated PDFs; a training process separate from the segmentation step. We found that signature-based priors were superior to location-based ones aligned under favorable conditions, and that signature-based priors result in improved segmentation when replacing location-based ones in FAST (Zhang et al., 2001), a widely used segmentation program.

Our studies, in the rat, demonstrate that GLP-1Rs in the locus coeruleus (LC) are pharmacologically and physiologically relevant for food intake control. Furthermore, agonism of LC GLP-1Rs induces illness-like behaviors, and antagonism of LC GLP-1Rs can attenuate GLP-1R-mediated nausea.

The drugs (i.v.) reduced BP and HR more markedly in SHR than in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The effects of bepridil were less pronounced and less prolonged than those of diltiazem. Bepridil relaxed arterial strips precontracted by KCl or prostaglandin F2 alpha to almost the same extent as diltiazem in both SHR and WKY. Bepridil was almost as potent as diltiazem in inhibiting non-competitively the Ca2+-evoked contractions of arteries depolarized in a Ca2+-free, high K+ buffer. alpha-Adrenoceptor agonist-induced contractions accompanied and not accompanied by Ca2+ influx were inhibited more markedly by bepridil than diltiazem under certain conditions. The inhibitions were more marked in SHR than in WKY. Thus, it was suggested that both drugs acted as Ca2+ influx inhibitor to reduce vascular tone. Bepridil inhibited intracellular vasoconstriction mechanisms linked with alpha-adrenoceptors more potently than did diltiazem in SHR.

However, multisensory neurons are distributed throughout the brain, suggesting that a wide range of brain regions are involved in generating multisensory behavior in addition to the superior colliculus. In this study, we aimed to use scalp EEG to elucidate the cortical responses that respond to multisensory stimuli according to the principle of inverse effectiveness. By modulating the intensity of the tactile aspect of a simultaneous visuotactile stimulus, we explored the time-frequency component of scalp EEG waveforms produced during multi-sensory stimulation. Using this method, we determined the relative values and temporal dynamics of the increment of power spectrum (event-related spectrum perturbation) and phase coherence across trials (e.g., inter-trial phase coherency) produced by multisensory stimulation compared to unisensory stimulation. In the somatosensory and anterior cingulate cortices, we observed significant differences in the inter-trial phase coherence of the theta band oscillation 200-400 ms post-stimulus, in response to visuotactile (multisensory) and tactile (unisensory) stimulation, while no differences were found in later time windows and other cortical areas. These results suggest that inverse effectiveness is an important aspect of multi-sensory processing in the somato-sensory and frontal cerebral cortices.",Brain Res,Brain research,1598,N/A,18-30,2025-11-04 11:09:46,2025-11-04 11:09:46

The objective of the present work was to further compare this reaction with the analogous oxidation of arginine via N-hydroxyarginine to citrulline and nitric oxide. The oxidation of N-hydroxydebrisoquine by liver microsomes from rats pretreated with dexamethasone not only produced nitric oxide and the urea, but also the cyanamide derivative as the main metabolite. The low stability of the cyanamide derivative, which easily hydrolyzed to the urea derivative, was noted. The formation of all compounds required cosubstrate and the enzyme source. Experiments with catalase, superoxide dismutase, and H2O2 showed that the O2- formed from the enzyme and the substrate apparently participated in the reaction. While the N-hydroxylation of the guanidine involves the usual monooxygenase activity of cytochrome P-450 (Clement et al., Biochem Pharmacol 46: 2249-2267, 1993), the resultant N-hydroxyguanidine decoupled the monooxygenase. Nitric oxide was detected by the oxyhemoglobin assay. To examine the influence of enzymatically formed nitric oxide on the formation of the metabolites, the N-hydroxydebrisoquine was incubated with SIN-1 as nitric oxide donor under aerobic conditions. It was again possible to detect the cyanamide and urea derivatives, with the latter as main metabolite. It was concluded that the microsomal transformation of N-hydroxydebrisoquine produces a cyanamide and nitric oxide which reacts with N-hydroxydebrisoquine to form the urea derivative. The purely chemical reaction of the unsubstituted N-hydroxyguanidine with nitric oxide gave similar results (Fukuto et al., Biochem Pharmacol 43: 607-613, 1992). In conclusion, similarities (formation of a urea derivative) and differences (formation of a cyanamide derivative) between the physiological oxidation of N-hydroxy-L-arginine by nitric oxide synthases and non-physiological N-hydroxyguanidines by cytochrome P-450 were observed. Furthermore, non-physiological N-hydroxyguanidines can be regarded as nitric oxide donors.",Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,58,3,439-45,2025-11-04 11:09:54,2025-11-04 11:09:54

Dose-dependent sparing of white matter is seen at 1 month after injury that is correlated to the dose-related reduction in chronic functional deficits. To determine whether NBQX exerts an acute effect on white matter pathology, female, adult Spague Dawley rats were subjected to a standardized weight drop contusion at T-8 (10 gm x 2.5 cm) and NBQX (15 nmol) or vehicle (VEH) solution focally injected into the injury site 15 min later. At 4 and 24 hr, tissue from the injury epicenter was processed for light and electron microscopy, and the histopathology of ventromedial white matter was compared. The axonal injury index, a quantitative representation of axoplasmic and myelinic pathologies, was significantly lower in the NBQX group at 4 hr (2.7 +/- 0.24, mean +/- SE) and 24 hr (1.4 +/- 0.19) than in VEH controls (3.8 +/- 0.33 and 2.1 +/- 0.20, respectively). Counts of glial cell nuclei indicated a loss of at least 60% at 4 and 24 hr after injury in the VEH group compared with uninjured controls. NBQX treatment reduced this glial loss by half.

The glucocorticoid dexamethasone suppresses cortisol in horses.

Overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) protocols are used to test the functioning of this mechanism and to establish a diagnosis for PPID. However, existing DST protocols have been recognized to perform poorly in previous experimental studies, often indicating presence of PPID in healthy horses. This study uses a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling approach to analyse the oscillatory cortisol response and its interaction with dexamethasone. Two existing DST protocols were then scrutinized using model simulations with particular focus on their ability to avoid false positive outcomes. Using a Bayesian population approach allowed for quantification of uncertainty and enabled predictions for a broader population of horses than the underlying sample.

36231379,"Marcin Jachowicz, Grzegorz Owczarek",2022,Studies of Acceleration of the Human Body during Overturning and Falling from a Height Protected by a Self-Locking Device.,"The use of individual fall protection equipment is one of the most commonly applied methods of protecting workers whose worksites are located above the floor level. The safety of the user in such a situation depends on both the proper selection and correct use of such equipment. Additionally, aspects such as minimizing the free-fall distance before the fall arrest, as well as quick notification of an accident and efficient rescue operation, are important factors influencing safety. This paper presents a new testing method for fall arrest equipment using a test stand consisting of the Hybrid III 50th Pedestrian ATD anthropomorphic manikin and measuring set with three-axis acceleration transducers. The proposed method and test stand were developed for the design and testing of new fall protection devices equipped with electronic detection and alarm systems, for which it is necessary to determine acceleration limits in order to determine the alarm threshold. The proposed method is based on the measurement of accelerations that occur during tipping and falling from the height of an anthropomorphic manikin secured by a self-locking device. Two places of attachment of the measuring set with a three-axis acceleration sensor were analyzed at the waist belt of the manikin (abdomen and back). Moreover, the self-locking device lanyard was attached to the two points of the safety harnesses (the front and back point). The aim of the research was to check whether the acceleration values depend on the places of attachment of the measuring and anchored system, as well as to determine their maximum values. Acceleration values corresponding to fall arrest and tipping were analyzed. Limits of acceleration have been established in order to determine the threshold of alarm triggering. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to check whether the location of the three-axis acceleration transducer and the position of the self-locking device lanyard attachment affect the value of the recorded acceleration. For results of acceleration measurements when testing the behavior of the manikin during fall arrest, no statistically significant differences were found. For results of acceleration measurements when testing the tipping behavior of the manikin, statistically significant differences occurred. This means that during fall arrest, the location of the three-axis acceleration transducer and the position of the self-locking device lanyard attachment do not matter. This work is a continuation of previous research on accelerations characterizing human body positions occurring during normal physical activities (ADL-activities of daily living).",Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,19,19,N/A,2025-11-04 11:10:02,2025-11-04 11:10:02

Kinetic and spectroscopic evidence.,"CO binding kinetics to the homodimeric myoglobin (Mb) from Nassa mutabilis has been investigated between pH 1.9 and 7.0. Protonation of the proximal imidazole at low pH (less than or equal to 3.0) and the consequent cleavage of the HisF8NE2-Fe proximal bond brings about a approximately 20-fold increase of the second-order rate constant for CO binding. This process displays a pKa = 4.0 +/- 0.2, significantly higher than that observed in all other deoxygenated hemoproteins investigated up to now. Such a feature underlies a decreased energy for the HisF8NE2-Fe proximal bond in the unliganded form and it also appears supported by resonance Raman spectroscopy in the low frequency region of the Fe(II) deoxygenated hemoprotein. Further, the pH-rate profile of N. mutabilis Mb, like that of the homodimeric hemoglobin (Hb) from Scapharca inaequivalvis (Coletta, M., Boffi, A., Ascenzi, P., Brunori, M. and Chiancone, E.

Using fMRI, we investigated the brain networks involved in representing contextual information and translating it into an attentional control signal. Human subjects performed a visual search task for a low-contrast target accompanied by a single non-target that was either perceptually similar or more salient (i.e., higher contrast). Shorter reaction times (RTs) and higher accuracy were found on salient trials, suggesting that the salient item was rapidly identified as a non-target and immediately acts as a spatial ""anti-cue"" to reorient attention to the target. The relative saliency of the non-target determined BOLD responses in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). IFG correlated with RT specifically on salient non-target trials. In contrast, bilateral dorsal frontoparietal regions [including the frontal eye fields (FEFs)] were correlated with RT in all conditions. Effective connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling found an excitatory pathway from TPJ to IFG to FEF, suggesting that this was the pathway by which the contextual cue was translated into an attentional control signal that facilitated behavior. Additionally, the connection from FEF to TPJ was negatively modulated during target-similar trials, consistent with the inhibition of TPJ by dorsal attentional control regions during top-down serial visual search.

Several control measures against E. amylovora have been reported till date, however, none of them have proved to be effective significantly against the pathogen. In this study, mechanisms of the copper-based control agents (CBCAs): copper oxychloride (COCHL), copper oxide (COX), copper hydroxide (CHY), copper sulfate basic (CSB), and tribasic copper sulfate (TCS) and their disease severity reduction efficacy against E. amylovora were analyzed. Bis-1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid trimethine oxonol, carboxyl fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride staining were used to check the damage of membrane potential, cytoplasmic pHin, and respiration of CBCAs-treated E. amylovora, respectively. High disturbance in the membrane potential of E. amylovora was found under COX and COCHL treatments. Similarly, higher significant changes in the inner cytoplasmic pHin were observed under COX, COCHL, and TCS treatment. CHY and COCHL-treated E. amylovora showed a significant reduction in respiration. In vitro bioassay results revealed that CHY, CSB, and TCS at 2,000 ppm reduced the severity of fire blight both in pre- and post-treatment of CBCAs in immature apple fruits and seedlings. Overall, the most effective CBCAs against E. amylovora could be CHY at 2,000 ppm as its showed inhibition mechanisms and disease severity reduction.",Plant Pathol J,The plant pathology journal,39,1,52-61,2025-11-04 11:10:07,2025-11-04 11:10:07

Low molecular weight pollutants, even at trace concentrations in water sources, have aroused global attention due to their toxicity after long-time exposure. There is an increased demand for appropriate methods to detect these pollutants in aquatic systems. Aptamers, single-stranded DNA or RNA, have high affinity and specificity to each of their target molecule, similar to antigen-antibody interaction. Aptamers can be selected using a method called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX). Recent years we have witnessed great progress in developing aptamer selection and aptamer-based sensors for low molecular weight pollutants in water sources, such as tap water, seawater, lake water, river water, as well as wastewater and its effluents.

However, the effects of these noise controls on the actual hearing status of workers are not easily measured. A tool that can provide guidance in assigning workers to jobs based on the noise levels to which they will be exposed is highly desirable. Therefore, the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division (PMRD) of the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a tool to estimate in a systematic way the hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure and to evaluate the effectiveness of developed engineering controls.

In this study, the contribution of the two substances to methanogenesis and the conversion in Zoige wetland were analyzed. It was determined that methanol supported the highest CH(4) formation rate in the enrichments of the soil grown with Eleocharis valleculosa, and even higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C; while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was higher at 30 degrees C. Both methanol- and acetate-using methanogens were counted at the highest (10(7) g(-1)) in the soil, whereas methanol-using acetogens (10(8) g(-1)) were ten times more abundant than either methanol- or acetate-using methanogens. Both methanol and acetate were detected in the methanogenesis-inhibited soil samples, so that both could be the primary methanogenic precursors in E. valleculosa soil. However, the levels of methanol and acetate accumulated in 2-bromoethane-sulfonate (BES)- and CHCl(3)-treated soils were in reverse, i.e., higher methanol in CHCl(3)- and higher acetate in BES-treated soil, so that methanol-derived methanogenesis could be underestimated due to the consumption by acetogens. Analysis of the soil 16S rRNA genes revealed Acetobacterum bakii and Trichococcus pasteurii to be the dominant methanol-using acetogens in the soil, and a strain of T. pasteurii was isolated, which showed the high conversion of methanol to acetate at 15 degrees C.",Microb Ecol,Microbial ecology,60,1,206-13,2025-11-04 11:10:12,2025-11-04 11:10:12

The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated using four animal models including xylene-induced mouse ear edema, acetic acid-induced mouse vascular permeability, carrageenan-induced mouse pleurisy, and carrageenan-induced mouse hind paw edema. Results indicated that oral administration of ERP (120, 240, and 480 mg/kg) significantly attenuated xylene-induced ear edema, decreased acetic acid-induced capillary permeability, inhibited carrageenan-induced neutrophils recruitment, and reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema, in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathologically, ERP (480 mg/kg) abated inflammatory response of the edema paw. Preliminary mechanism studies demonstrated that ERP decreased the level of MPO and MDA, increased the activities of anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GRd), attenuated the productions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, PGE₂ and NO, and suppressed the activities of COX-2 and iNOS.

This can be modelled by giving two consecutive intra-cisternal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rabbits, the first at 0 h to induce inflammation to mimic that occurring during the proliferation of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the second at 6 h to mimic inflammation subsequent to antibiotic-induced bacterial lysis. Injection of 2.5 ng of LPS induced pleocytosis at 4 h which was preceded by a peak of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) activity at 2 h. A subsequent injection of 25 ng of LPS at 6 h induced second peaks of pleocytosis and CSF TNF. Dexamethasone (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.) administered 15 min or 1 h before the second injection of LPS tended only to reduce CSF TNF, but effectively prohibited further pleocytosis. Brain TNF alpha mRNA levels were unchanged at 6 and 7 h after LPS injection, and were unaffected by dexamethasone. These results indicate that the subarachnoid space is distinct from the general circulation in that the TNF-producing cells present do not display a hypo-responsive state towards LPS as occurs when LPS is injected systemically. Furthermore, dexamethasone is able to attenuate the secondary inflammatory response resulting from a second LPS injection without eliminating a second peak of TNF activity.",J Med Microbiol,Journal of medical microbiology,43,1,37-44,2025-11-04 11:10:16,2025-11-04 11:10:16

The 2-desamino target compounds 13a-c,k also exhibited significant, although diminished, TS inhibition. Both series were growth inhibitory to cells in tissue culture and this inhibition could be reversed by thymidine alone, indicating that the primary target was TS.

Mycotoxins producing moulds may produce a diversity of toxins such as aflatoxins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins, tremorgenic toxins and ergot alkaloids. Although toxicological, environmental and epidemiological studies have addressed the problem of these toxins one by one, more than one mycotoxin are found usually in the same contaminated commodities. That rises the incommensurable problem of multi-toxicosis in which the respective metabolites are also involved. These mycotoxins bear potential toxicity leading to acute and chronic effects in humans and animals, depending on species. The mechanisms that lead to toxic effects, such as immune toxicity, and carcinogenicity are complexe. The risk assessment for humans potentially exposed to multi-mycotoxins suffers very much from the lack of adequate food consumption data. Furthermore, for a given mycotoxin synergism and antagonism with other mycotoxins found in the same food commodities are not taken into account. The case of combination of ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) has been addressed in the present paper with the purpose of predicting the in vivo toxicity using a simple in vitro test, i.e. neutral red uptake, in three different cell-lines, C6 glioma cells, Caco-2 cells and Vero cells.

They essentially consist of a single transmembrane domain and are associated with stress response mechanisms in bacteria. How these proteins are inserted into the bacterial membrane is unknown. Our study revealed that in Escherichia coli, the 27-amino-acid-long model protein YohP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), as indicated by in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking. Cross-links to SRP were also observed for a second small membrane protein, the 33-amino-acid-long YkgR. However, in contrast to the canonical cotranslational recognition by SRP, SRP was found to bind to YohP posttranslationally. In vitro protein transport assays in the presence of a SecY inhibitor and proteoliposome studies demonstrated that SRP and its receptor FtsY are essential for the posttranslational membrane insertion of YohP by either the SecYEG translocon or by the YidC insertase. Furthermore, our data showed that the yohP mRNA localized preferentially and translation-independently to the bacterial membrane in vivo. In summary, our data revealed that YohP engages an unique SRP-dependent posttranslational insertion pathway that is likely preceded by an mRNA targeting step. This further highlights the enormous plasticity of bacterial protein transport machineries.",PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,18,9,e3000874,2025-11-04 11:10:22,2025-11-04 11:10:22

Although a high degree of conservation exists between the N-α-terminal acetylomes of plants and animals, very little information is available on this modification in plants. In yeast and humans, N-α-acetyltransferase complexes include a single catalytic subunit and one or two auxiliary subunits. Here, we report the positional cloning of TRANSCURVATA2 (TCU2), which encodes the auxiliary subunit of the NatB N-α-acetyltransferase complex in Arabidopsis. The phenotypes of loss-of-function tcu2 alleles indicate that NatB complex activity is required for flowering time regulation and for leaf, inflorescence, flower, fruit and embryonic development. In double mutants, tcu2 alleles synergistically interact with alleles of ARGONAUTE10, which encodes a component of the microRNA machinery. In summary, NatB-mediated N-α-terminal acetylation of proteins is pleiotropically required for Arabidopsis development and seems to be functionally related to the microRNA pathway.",PLoS One,PloS one,8,11,e80697,2025-11-04 11:10:25,2025-11-04 11:10:25

Promoting a patient safety culture in health services optimally includes midwifery and nursing. The first aim of this study is to assess the University Perinatal Center’s staff members’ perceptions of safety culture. A second aim is to identify how the perceptions of safety culture actors are related to the socio-demographic characteristic of the respondents. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational design was applied in this study. Registered nurses and midwives were recruited from the University Perinatal Center in Lithuania (N = 233). Safety culture was measured by the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ). Results: The mean scores of the responses on the 6 factors of the SAQ ranged from 3.18 (0.46) (teamwork climate) to 3.79 (0.55) (job satisfaction) points. The percentage of positive responses to the SAQ (4 or 5 points on the Likert scale) ranged from 43.2% to 69.0%. The lowest percentage of the respondents provided positive responses to the questions on perception of management and teamwork climate, while the highest percentage of the respondents provided positive responses to the questions on job satisfaction. Perception of management positively correlated with safety climate (r = 0.45, p < 0.01) and working conditions (r = 0.307, p < 0.01). Safety climate positively correlated with job satisfaction (r = 0.397, p < 0.01) and working conditions (r = 0.307, p < 0.01). Job satisfaction positively correlated with working conditions (r = 0.439, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Evaluating the opinions of the safety climate among nurses and midwives who work at the University Perinatal Center showed that teamwork climate and perception of management are weak factors. Therefore, stakeholders should organize more training about patient safety and factors that affect patient safety.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,19,16,N/A,2025-11-04 11:10:28,2025-11-04 11:10:28

In general, the methanol extracts inhibited the enzymes more effectively than the aqueous extracts. HIV-1 protease was strongly inhibited by the methanol extract of Alpinia galanga. This extract also inhibited HCV and HCMV proteases, but to a lower degree. HCV protease was most efficiently inhibited by the extracts from Zingiber officinale, with little difference between the aqueous and the methanol extracts. Many of the methanol extracts inhibited HCMV protease, but the aqueous extracts showed weak inhibition. In a first endeavor to identify the active constituents, eight flavones were isolated from the black rhizomes of Kaempferia parviflora. The most effective inhibitors, 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone and 5,7-dimethoxyflavone, inhibited HIV-1 protease with IC50 values of 19 microM.

Superfusion of GT1-1 cells with DA or the D1-dopaminergic agonist SKF 38393, but not with the D2-dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine, increased 2-fold the amplitude of the spontaneous GnRH pulses. Treatment with DA for 30 min also stimulated GnRH release from static cultures of GT1-7 cells. This effect was mimicked by the selective D1-dopaminergic agonist SKF 38393 and blocked by the D1-dopaminergic antagonist SCH 23390. However, the D2-dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine had no effect, and the stimulation of GnRH release by DA was not blocked by the D2-dopaminergic antagonist spiroperidol. In parallel to the stimulation of GnRH release, DA also rapidly increased (first observed at 120 sec) in a dose-dependent fashion, the intracellular concentration of cAMP in isobutylmethylxanthine-pretreated GT1-7 cells. The pharmacological profile of the increase in cAMP was identical to that for GnRH release. The cAMP responses to DA and norepinephrine were lost after long term treatment with SKF 38393, i.e. heterologous desensitization. GT1 cells also express the mRNA for the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phospho-protein (mol wt, 32,000; DARPP-32) only seen in cells expressing DA D1-receptors.

This study investigated physical pain of nurses and their pain self-management in mainland China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 2458 full-time nurses working in 18 hospitals across mainland China were studied from May 2016 to July 2016, of which a total of 1269 nurses (51.63%) experienced pain during the duration of this study. RESULTS Of the nurses reporting pain, most had general chronic pain (936 cases, 73.8%). Many nurses also had moderate to severe pain (904 cases, 71.2%). Another type of pain that was common was back and lower-limb pain (740 cases, 58.3%). Of the diagnosable symptoms, lumbar spondylosis was the most prominent, with 258 cases (33.1%). Nearly 50% of the nurses reported that their lives and sleep had been disrupted by pain, and 33.9% of the subjects are unsatisfied with their level of self-management of pain. Only 13.4% said that they would seek formal medical attention after feeling pain. Multivariate logistical analysis showed that factors such as the level of the hospital, years of experience, and shift schedule have a strong correlation with the incidence of pain among nurses.

Pristimerin, a quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families, is well-known to exert potential anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated the effects and the mechanisms of action on CML. We found that pristimerin inhibited cell proliferation of K562 CML cells by causing G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pristimerin triggered autophagy and apoptosis. Intriguingly, pristimerin-induced cell death was restored by an autophagy inhibitor, suggesting that autophagy is cross-linked with pristimerin-induced apoptosis. Further studies revealed that pristimerin could produce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then induce JNK activation.
